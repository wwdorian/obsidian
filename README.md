# My PKM on obsidian.md

This is my PKM on obsidian.md. My research mainly focus on literature, history, and anything philosophical. But I do also have projects on management and law and etc. So, feel free to clone the whole vault and open it using your obsidian. Just play around!

As a common user I do not really want to sign up for its official publish service. That's why you'll see it here. By the way, GitHub offers version control, which would be great for me if I edit the files here and there.
