### the body is undefinable after all

It could be argued that the body is the self since it is what we use to build our identities - but is our bodies equivalent to our identities? I assume otherwise.
And there are so many things that resist definitions. For instance, what is meaning? And what is meaning's meaning? On and on, it only leads to tautology. The idea of definition for everything is such a tradition that it refers to no alteration but omniscience - which is God's job.
Simply put, it's not possible that everything is definable. The body is something concrete, which I don't object, but it being something corporeal doesn't mean that it is something we can conceptualise and break down to small pieces - which ironically leads to the idea of building it back to its former state. i.e. being alive, which is shown in the novel *Frankenstein*.

> For the body is notoriously difficult to theorise or pin down, because it is mutable, in perpetual flux, different from day to day and resistant to conceptual definition. Hence, although many recent philosophers, scientists and writers seem to suggest that the body *is* the self, it also poses a serious challenge to received notions of identity and subjectivity.
