### Scholarly Writing
Writing is a fundamental human behaviour that generates new insights, to me. But in life we need to write in many different scenarios, for example, in academics. And this leads to academic writing, one kind of which is scholarly writing.

Scholarly writing is, unlike many other kinds of academic writing, peer reviewed - to provide reliability and authenticity. And therefore, when we review these scholarly articles, we should also write on them, so as to deepen our understanding and to develop our ideas.

There are 2 basic types of scholarly writing:
1. [[annotated bibliography]]
2. [[how to write an article summary]]
