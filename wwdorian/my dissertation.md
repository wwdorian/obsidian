# Research on the Protagonist's Gender Identity in Virginia Woolf's Orlando, From a Foucauldian Perspective on Sex and Body

### Abstract

### Introduction

### The Book and the Protagonist

*Orlando: A Biography (Orlando)* was written from the third perspective, which gives the reader a sense of truthfulness. The book, however, is a fantasy story, partly, since the eponymous protagonist lives for over four hundred years, who also had undergone a miraculous sex change during that period. But, according to Virginia Woolf herself, the book is also partly a biography, which is intended to be fictional, of her friend and lover, Vita-Sackville West {Tate, 2020 #28}.
