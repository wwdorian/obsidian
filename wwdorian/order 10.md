## reflections

### week 1

In this week, I have learnt that the concept of sustainability accounting and reporting, both work as a fundamental part of a corporation's attitude towards sustainability. In short, sustainability is not only about how long a corporation might live, but also about how the actions of the corporation can affect the environment and be affected by the results of those actions in return. Two areas stand out: carbon accounting and integrated reporting. And it must be acknowledged that the current accounting study needs further research, such as transferred focus from on the reporters to on the stakeholders.

### week 2

In this week, new ideas were introduced. The environment issues are increasingly raising concern both locally and globally, and the accounting profession has a role to play in it. Corporations' actions would affect the environment, and it thus becomes a duty to report. Whether there is authentic reporting that focuses on actions to protect the environment or not is the issue. Some corporations would instead concentrate on strategies of the company but we know certainly that strategies are only on paper, not in reality. But the environment is exactly what we live in in our corporeal human form. The interactions between human and the environment is the key.

### week 3

Shareholders must be differentiated from the concept of stakeholders which constitutes the stakeholder theory brought in by Freeman (1984) in his landmark book *Strategic Management*. Shareholders are anyone who has at least one share in a company, but who does not have obligation for it. That means, shareholders care about profits, while stakeholders would have to care about how the company runs and etc. The point is in incorporating the concept of stakeholders, corporations could elevate its current management especially concerning environmental stewardship.

### week 4

Accounting is inseparable from accountability in a corporation, I learnt from this weeks classes that corporations must be responsible for the stakeholders and also for the public. Accounting serves as the analytical tool that a corporation uses  as a way to show the public that the company is being responsible through periodic disclosures. However, institutionally speaking, the  institutional reform that has taken place in the last years have proved of little value. Corporations must learn to incorporate the idea of being accountable in both financial and environmental sectors to further their legitimacy.

### week 5

In this week, the point that I'm most concerned as well as curious about is the topic of sustainability regulation. The importance of Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) should be aware globally since it becomes investment concerns when it comes to Socially Responsible Investment (SRI), which would include for sure the stakeholders. Corporations have the moral and financial obligations to stakeholders who invested in them, also the duty to be responsible for the environment since they themselves are a form of investments. What we invest on the environment will have to pay or to be paid by our future generations.

### week 6

Again I focus on this week the issue of sustainability reporting practices. Public scrutiny is a powerful device for pushing corporations to be more environmentally responsible. The more the public raises concerns on corporate behaviours that would be harmful to the environment, the more the government would have to react and act, who works on the regulation part. And that regulation, apart from public scrutiny, would very much result in corrupt. The point is still, public scrutiny. Both the government and corporations must understand that they actions would affect the people through affecting the environment.

### week 7

This week my thoughts are basically on the carbon emission and its relation to the market and accounting in corporations. Accounting has long been a math as well as a science, but it's now not quite up to date. The reasons are multiple, but the fact that it fails to incorporate environmental factors into its framework result in some failures. A market of carbon control is surely a good idea, but maybe accounting can learn something in it. The frameworks need to be updated, the ideas, methodology, formulations.. all of them.

### week 8

Integrated reporting should be given more attention in accounting and in the actual business process of opening data and disclosing details to the public, I reckon in this week. The actual benefit from integrated reporting might not be quite straightforward, but the long term good it will do is undeniable. An ethically good and well functioned company is always more trustworthy for both consumers and investors. The market will prove even though it's not within a few months.

## article summaries

### week 1-4 article summary

Hopwood (2009) argued in the article that accounting would still constitute a crucial portion in the coming world, where there are more awareness about the environmental problems and where the human race will devote more to improve the relationship between the human dimension and the natural one, thus to eventually benefit the race.

Through addressing the problems by browsing through the accounting research at that time as well as through reviewing existing literature, both Lodhia (2007) as well as Hopwood concluded that the prevalent research wasn't be able to fully satisfy the role that accounting would play in the coming changes in the market where accounting would still be useful to design and evaluate business schemes which have consideration for the overall effect that business activities might bring upon the environment. Hopwood specifically addressed the creation of a market in carbon emissions while Lodhia started from global environmental issues.

Hopwood suggested that accounting, as a calculative mechanism along with other disciplines, can and cannot play certain roles in the environmental area. The author argued that there is still a long way to go for accounting to become closely compatible with the market, and insisted that production would and should be more environmentally efficient, which would require further development of research in accounting.

Hopwood specially made an analysis of the creation of a market in carbon emissions, which requires attention because it was influenced by a collection of complex factors that was not considered. This was because the accounting framework wasn't adaptable enough with the market. Hopwood also mentioned the growing need for corporate environmental and financial performance reporting, which delve into the underlying corporate environmental activities and results. But these reporting would have more functions, according to the author, who argued in the article that they would potentially increase companies' public image and legitimacy, which results possibly in companies being interrogated less and thus the information being veiled more despite the exterior openness. The author gave an example of this through mentioning the BT Group plc who won the top 2008 United Kingdom Awards for Sustainability Reporting, in whose reporting the stress of tone was mainly on strategies rather than actions.

In these articles the authors used clear-cut questions on the need to further the current accounting research, in order to be more compatible with the actual market that is continuously more concerned about the environmental issues. By strategically analysing the creation of a market in carbon emissions, Hopwood successfully pointed out the importance of such development. And by considering the factor of corporate reporting, Lodhia used several actual examples that support the viewpoint of a better framework which would be proved to be an impetus for such further study in accounting. With these the authors explained the significance of the articles.

### week 5-8 article summary

**Article Summary of Week 5 Readings**

Deegan and Blomquist (2006) in their article discussed the influence that one of WWF-Australia's initiatives have had on the environmental reporting of the Australian minirals industry, and further in their study considered and investigated the role that lobby groups have played in corporate disclosure policies. And Lodhia (2012) in his article studied the role that regulation can play in Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) in which he put focus on social and environmental issues.

Deegan and Blomquist employed the method of studying a specific case, i.e. the case that involves both the WWF environmental conservation organisation, and the interactions between the Minerals Council of Australia (MCA), to determine how and essentially whether potential corporate disclosure policies and practices may be affected by exterior interest groups, such as WWF. Lodhia in his work listed various forms of voluntary initiatives and several mandatory CSR schemes that led to the concept of Sustainability Reporting and Integrated Reporting to finally answer the question: whether to regulate or not?

Deegan and Blomquist, by specifically study the WWF-Australia, used interviews to better understand the reason behind WWF's actions as well as the MCA's reactions to those actions. The authors interviewed the people who are relevant instead of fetching secondary data. Interviewees were cautiously chosen from the two organisations above and some other companies in minerals industry. Interviewees were also able to add extra information whenever they feel need to.

By finding out what related people felt about the WWF and using the interview instrument, the researchers were able to be certain that WWF, as one kind and member of interest groups which include lobby organisations, would need to be acknowledged for their impact on sustainability management and reporting of corporations, but also that the Codes and scorecards won't suffice. The key issue needs to be addressed that even though organisations are prepared to listen to NGOs, the advice from NGOs might be unrealistic in that it may cause not change but transmutation in the fundamental structure of the "economic organisation" of societies, for example, Australia.

Lodhia in his article analysed several initiatives and reached the conclusion that both types of mechanisms have become important in corporate agenda. However, while corporations might have understood the importance of social and environmental responsibilities that fall on their shoulders, the question cannot be easily answered that whether or not the planet can function well in the hands of business. Quite surprisingly, for instance, certification schemes would provide companies already performing well with more advantages but do not show this trait of working in other companies.

Both authors of the weekly articles addressed the problems of regulation and interest groups' influence on corporate sustainability reporting and thus their policies, and by respectively using thorough analysis and interviews empirically, the authors both reached the answers that regulations and exterior influence are of importance and work in certain areas, but there need further research and development in the study of a more authentic reporting in accounting.
