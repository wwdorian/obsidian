### we have lost our touch with great books
The world is losing touch with their great books which are their tradition and heritage, in the West of course, but what about the East? People worldwide are not accessing their ancestors' wisdom (this of course presupposes that they did have wisdom and is provable). This deviation (if it could be called as one) does worth some serious consideration.
> Until lately the West has regarded it as self-evident that the road to education lay through great books.

### great books help us become educated
A man should be familiar with the masterpieces, especially books, of his tradition if he wants to be (called) "educated".
It is most certainly a 'standard'. But by who was it made? History? I'm not saying it's nonsense, I do agree in fact. But still, who made this standard? Or should it not be viewed as one, instead, however, as a perspective?
> No man was educated unless he was acquainted with the masterpieces of his tradition.

### great books' value is tested by time
Great books are time-enduring. Their value increase over time, and is in exponential growth. They are available to everyone but are known to only a limited number of people. However, everyone is able to discern them from the junk books. The shinning gold among the dust.
What great books will we leave for the next generation?
> There never was very much doubt in anybody's mind about which the masterpieces were. They were the books that had endured and that the common voice of mankind called the finest creations, in writing, of the Western mind.

### great books are a toolkit to understand other books
Great books are themselves a toolkit that, unlike those nowadays so-called "once and for all" books, provide their readers with better understanding of the world by offering the mindsets contained in them.
It's never about **what** were written in them, since information may get outdated.
But that **how** they were conceived of really matters, since by incorporating those ways of thinking into our cognitive process would in large measure lead us to the essence of things because they had been proven by these books themselves.
> We think that the spirit they represent and the habit of mind they teach are more necessary today than ever before. We think that the reader who does his best to understand these books will find himself led to read and helped to understand other books. We think that reading and understanding great books will give him a standard by which to judge all other books.

### great books can help solve our problems
The idea is plain and simple: these books would help us solve our problems. There's nothing new in the sun. And to be frank, one basic part of intelligence is marked by its retrieval of past knowledge, in the sense of which we should be regarded as morons by the fact that we stopped learning from our wise predecessors. History - origin - problem - solution - intelligence - now everything connects.
> We do not think that these books will solve all our problems. We do not think that they are the only books worth reading. We think that these books shed some light on all our basic problems, and that it is folly to do without any light we can get. We think that these books show the origins of many of our most serious difficulties.
