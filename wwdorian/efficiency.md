Efficiency asks: _How easily could we do it?_

But, efficiency cannot by itself ensure successful management
.
Since it only considers the _"how"_, but ignored the _"what"_.
That's where [[effectiveness]] comes in.

### Example - Australia Post's Partnership with the China Post and Sai Cheng Logistics

Australia Post has reduced freight costs and increased efficiency by developing a partnership with the China Post and Sai Cheng Logistics.
This partnership has created an efficient supply chain between Australia and China, allowing for direct contact between suppliers in China and consumers in Australia, subsequently reducing freight and middle man costs.
