# 1

Tanzania has witnessed its economic growth in the past decade, with the annual GDP growth rate of 7%, which is remarkbale. Moreover, the child survival, aka the reduction of child mortality rates, as well as school enrolment has improved much more than before it underwent neoliberal development interventions.

# 2

The main shortcomings are multi-faceted. But generally the problems lay in the human development in Tanzania. Like mentioned in the previous card, those developments are only marginal. Succinctly, the economic growth on its own would not be able to promote the living standard of the majority of Tanzanians to the level that they would value and would regard as satisfying. The mere expansion of output of the economy would not generate the outcome of qulitatively change the people's lives, even though they are really welcomed.

The problem is that the idea of economic growth should go hand in hand with a systematical reform and a transformation in the overall economic growth model. The country should focus more on the qualitative features of the economy's production that occur throughout the growth process.

In a word, it needs an economic transformation not only in its form but also in its content, which focus on human development.

From this point of view, the report argues that the growth should be augmented by focusing on transforming the major economy from agriculture to the industrial and service sectors, with a demographic transition from high birth and death rates to low ones, while also invest resources in creating employment opportunities, income growth, and social provisions.

# 4

I would really like to ask the following questions:

1.  From what perspective should we define "human development"? And how should we define it?

2.  What is the result of this development? What can it bring not only to the economy as a synonym for country, but also to the people?

3.  Is it possible to reform Tanzania's economy? From what angles?
