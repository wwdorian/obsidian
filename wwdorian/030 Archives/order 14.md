### Project
Xblade Speed Demons football boots Advertising Creative Brief

### Background Overview

> FILE NOTE: I haven’t had time to complete the general Xblade company background but that shouldn’t take you too long from their website and company searches.

XBlades Australia Pty Ltd, founded by David Miers, is an Australian manufacturing company in the sports equipment industry, who primarily produce footwear and clothing, and the company created the first bladed sole football boot which is specially designed for athletes to mitigate the effect caused by injury {Wikipedia, 2021 #92}. The company remains a leader in the market of bladed soles, which still serves as the foundation of the company, with its innovations in technology and outranks its competitors in the field {XBlades Australia Pty Ltd, 2021 #90}.

### Category Overview

> FILE NOTE: I haven’t had time to complete the general overview of the product category for junior football boots so you will need to do some research there.

The company currently holds several product lines, including three sections: footwear, apparel, and others. Junior football boots fall in the footwear section and include four types of boots: Animal JNR 2020, Intercept Flash JNR 2020, Voltaic Adrenaline JNR 2020, and Jet Max JNR 2020 which is currently unavailable for sale. These boots all feature some key characteristics, such as light weight microfibre upper designed to reduce foot fatigue, as well as one of the company's key competencies, i.e., the outsole being one kind of the bladed soles. They all received positive comments on online stores from parents who purchased them for their children. 


### Competitors 

> FILE NOTE: I haven’t had time to document a Competitor analysis, but it includes Nike and Adidas and Asics are the main three competitors in the football codes product suppliers being considered.

Main competitors of the company in the footwear market: Nike Australia Pty Ltd (Nike AU), Adidas Australia Pty Limited (Adidas AU), Asics Oceania Pty Ltd (Asics OC).

Nike AU is the largest player in sports footwear by market share and has been experiencing steady yearly growth. Nike AU generates most of its revenue from retailing and wholesaling by managing its own stores and outlet network, as well as by maintaining long-term relationship with sports retailers through wholesale contracts. The company is a subsidiary of the sportswear giant Nike, Inc {Company 360, 2021 #93}.

Adidas AU is a local subsidiary of German based Adidas AG who is one of the largest sports manufacturers in the world. In 2019, the company's first quarter sales went up by 4%. Recent years have seen the company's outstanding performance in marketing and advertising, with its collaboration with prestigious designers, and high-profile celebrities, which boosted the company's social image and motivated its expansion into a new market driven by consumers' enthusiasm for designer leisure & workout wear {Company 360, 2021 #94}. 

Asics OC, as the regional subsidiary of the Japan-based ASICS Corporation, is a dominant importer and distributor of sports products in Australia. The company's flagship product is its Onitsuka tiger, also known as the "Tiger" sports shoe.

### Advertising Campaign Details

#### Purpose | Why?

> The purpose of the XBlade Speed Demon advertising campaign is to launch a new product line of football boots aimed at the junior (10 years old to 18 years old) AFL, rugby league and rugby union players.
> 
> The point-of-difference for the Speed Demon line is that it will fill a gap between the adult professional football boot lines and the current junior lines. Speed Demons will provide the high-end quality (made from kangaroo leather) and high tech innovations from the adult line boots, with some online only customization available (initials embroidered on boots opposite logo). The Speed Demons will be available with these features in child sizes only for $135.

The footwear market is a consumer market which includes all kinds of shoes for retailing and wholesaling. And as trends set it, the market is now undergoing a tremendous change that leads the market to become more shaped by consumer habits. The athletic footwear is then in the category, specifically designed for sports. Statistics show that the average retail value per unit in this market is increasing year by year, from AU\$179.52 in 2012 to AU\$203.50 in 2020 and is expected to grow in coming years {Statista, n.d. #96}.

However, the market now mainly focuses on the adult line products, such as adult sports boots. This advertising proposal is exactly to fill that gap before there is any other company recognise it. Junior boots were initially designed for that purpose, and the company has had several lines of production. However, there still is not a junior boot in the market that is specifically designed, high end, combining both innovations in technology from adult line, and the characteristics of junior boots curated for kids. This brief proposes to advertise the XBlades Speed Demon line in order to take more market volume for the company and to offer a brand-new quality choice for consumers.

#### Opportunity | Ultimate Impact?

> - Xblade is a relatively new player on the football boot market. 
> - We would like to increase brand awareness of our junior line.
> - Ultimately we would like to be ‘top of mind’ for junior players right through their development into the professional leagues and secure market share from our competitors.
> - We would like to be known as the best quality and value for money juniors football boot in the market and be the dominant player choice for junior football boots in the Southern Hemisphere.

XBlades Australia has spread its name in Australia and around the world due to its innovations in bladed soles for footwear design and manufacturing. The company strives to receive more positive feedback from the market and from consumers, the innovations being the proof of the efforts the company commits to the purpose.

As it is shown above, the market is not yet consolidated, even though there are some powerful competitors in the current market who are supported by large funds. XBlades, however, has the advantage to get over them with its innovations. Creativity is what two or more basic elements compositing together. XBlades have a strong reputation in junior boots while it is still relatively new to this market. But the most agile would gain the firsthand advantage, i.e., to become what consumers first make contact with in their minds, if the company can publish this new line of boots and if the advertising and marketing are of positive influence.

The ultimate impact would be to become consumers' first choice when it comes to buying shoes for kids, and the brand would be more well-known for its high quality, innovative technology, and its creativity that led to technological disruption in the market for other players. However, the ultimate impact should only be reached after the release of Speed Demon is successfully marketed. Since consumers are already aware of the junior boots line, the company should invest more in technological innovation instead of securing market share, so as to become more competent.

### Objective

> As the product category of junior football boots (including the Xblade junior lines) already exists it is past the stage where informative advertising to create consumer need is of benefit.
> 
> Therefore, the current project will focus on persuasive advertising to allow for market share to be competitively obtained for the Speed Demon line.
> 
> FILE NOTE: The client has participated in previous campaigns and has some familiarity with Advertising concepts. The client is happy to consider a SMART approach or a DAGMAR approach to formally documenting the advertising goals.
> 
> Over time, when market share targets are achieved, subsequent campaigns will move to a reminder objective for repetition purposes suiting the junior transitioning each upcoming season.

The current objective for this campaign should be focused on obtaining market share for the Speed Demon line, instead of informing the audience of the junior boots line. Therefore, the objective could be analysed using the SMART principle.

Specific: This campaign is to increase consumer awareness of the current Speed Demon junior boots line, in order to take measurable volume in the junior footwear and the athletic footwear market. This campaign should concentrate on the outstanding combination of technologies used in the product, and it would be misleading if this veers off to function as informing of the junior boots lines.

Measurable: The outcome must be measurable. This campaign should collect and analyse data for business research, e.g., potential risks and disruptions. The campaign should also collect comments from online stores and social media, receiving feedback from retailing shops and company stores. The data should contain at least user profiles, such as age, preferences, years, purposes of purchasing, reasons of the purchase, and some comments from them. The data should be analysed quarterly, in order to keep up with the climate.

Attainable: The objective for this campaign should be concrete and attainable. This campaign will only focus on branding XBlades and the Speed Demon footwear, instead of other lines of the company. The advertising and marketing is to control more market share by disrupt the market with a product competitors can not predict. 

Relevant: The objective of this campaign should be still related to other objectives other than to advertise the Speed Demon product line. The campaign should also be able to promote the current market share of the company even though this is not the primary goal. Besides, the campaign should promote the company's social image by improving its reputation in committing to high quality as well as extended considerations for juniors.

Time bound: This campaign should not exceed the time limit that will be set up, and must receive enough feedback to retrieve data to analyse the products situation, in order to react agily to the changes in the business environment.



### Target Audience

#### Project Target

> FILE NOTE: I haven’t had time to fully explore the project target and brand target market to quality and define. However, from the initial client meeting, the target demographic is junior (10 years old to 18 years old) AFL, rugby league and rugby union players and those who purchase for that target demographic.

The project target for this campaign are demographically segmented, and the main consumers should be junior AFL, rugby league and rugby union players who are from 10 years old to 18 years old. The project should reach the intended customers via social media as its primary communication channel as social media is widely used among juniors.

#### Brand Target

The brand should reach the targeted customers with correct strategies. The brand targets customers who are enthusiastic with well-known brands. These juniors would purchase brand-driven, and are often sports players. 

### Attitude

#### Project Tone

> FILE NOTE: From the initial client discussions, the client wanted a project tone that was consistent with overall existing company tone and junior football lines tone. However, they are open to creative ideas on how to achieve that tone. There is some general information about the overall Xblade brand and how it relates to the new Speed Demon line yet – but here is the company link to get you started [https://xblades.com.au/](https://xblades.com.au/)

The project should speak to consumers in a tone that is young, enthusiastic, and friendly. The tone should also speak in the way with which the juniors are familiar with.


#### Brand Personality

> FILE NOTE: personality is a new exploration for XBlades for their junior line. The current overall brand personality for XBlades is listed on their website as four key characteristics of (1) energetic culture, creative innovation, insurgent minds and gritty hearts. The client is happy to consider how they could translate this brand personality to be clearly understood by the Speed Demon target market.

The brand should be outgoing, and should showing care for juniors. The personality should be energetic, creative, insurgent, and gritty, in a way that is welcoming to juniors, in the meantime showing care for their health and foot condition.


### Message

#### The Takeaway | what is the key idea to be remembered?

> FILE NOTE:  the client stated they would like ‘top of mind’ for junior players right through their development into the professional leagues.  They are open to suggestions for what the key idea should be and how it can best be communicated.

The key idea to be remembered is that this product line, i.e., Speed Demon, should be granted to be a guaranteed product that not only considers consumers' health condition, but also is willing to help them excel at what they do.

#### Tagline | Prepared copy, key words, or theme

> FILE NOTE:  sorry I haven’t been able to come up with anything for this section yet as it was too rushed before I left work, you will need to think about what would be suitable and make suggestions here for the campaign.

Key words: Agile, Advanced, Amiable, Attentive.
Theme: The best choice of junior boots when it comes to both safety and excellence.


### Essential Elements

#### Design elements that need to be included

> FILE NOTE:  Can you please think about any specific concept decisions that need to be included in the design elements or layouts that need to be included as part of the advertising strategy.  These include (but are not limited too) decisions on:-
> 
> TARGET MARKET IMAGES: Famous young athletes and celebrities.
> 
> BOOT COLOUR: Red, Orange, and Black.
> 
> MUSIC: Chillstep (genre), Dubstep (genre).
> 
> LOGOS: XBaldes official logo with a lighter sensation.
> 
> PREFERRED POSITIONING OF ITEMS IN LAYOUT:
> 
> You will need to provide a draft advertisement suitable for a social media posting for their existing media to give Bernie in the design team something to work from.  Just put some annotations on each of your choices on the ‘mock up’ so he knows why you put them there and how important they are.



### Additional comments

> FILE NOTE:  the client has relied previously on web presence and combined Social media channels of Facebook, Twitter and Insta.  I also found a little bit on LinkedIn.  I am not sure how well suited this is to the target market.
>
>  Also there has been a small number of Youtube assets developed but not widely viewed.  While there are a number of different lines advertising messages across a number of channels, my initial thoughts are it doesn’t seem ‘pulled together’ yet, so they might need some help there as well.
>  
>  The client has asked for advice on
>  - whether or not other channels might suit the product launch?  Could we also supply ‘ball park’ of cost for any additional channels so budgets can be considered for additional options.
>  - Whether we could consider using his wife’s favourite player Russell Packer as a celebrity endorsement of the new line
