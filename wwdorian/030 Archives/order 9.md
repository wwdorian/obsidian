### Introduction (not to the article): 203

This research is focused on the sustainability development in the business world, where the discipline of accounting as a practice has been applied to nearly every aspect of business processes. Accounting is a science within the study of economists, and it should get more attention of economists in that it empowers data and thus the business processes with accountability {Hopwood, 2009 #2}. However, as global environmental issues raise increasing concern, accounting has not been able to keep pace, i.e., there have only been a few accounting theories related to the sustainability aspect of corporations as well as other organisations {Lodhia, 2013 #1}.

Sustainability development is at the very core of sustainability economics {Bartelmus, 2010 #3}. Sustainability economics could be given a definition as economic efficiency and justice together as an amalgamation in distribution and has as an impetus led to many other concepts such as Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) {Baumgärtner, 2010 #4}. Although this definition was challenge later by Van den Bergh, CSR{van den Bergh, 2010 #5}, given the fact that the global environmental issues, and by giving some thoughts on the COVID-19 pandemic as well as the Australian bushfires in 2020, it is indeed a path that is worth taking.

### Summary of the Reviewed Article

This reviewed article, by inspecting CSR expenditure of Bangladeshi banks, strives to examine the relationship between CSR expenditure and a corporation's market value, to answer how and why corporations should consider their investment in CSR and disclose the information to the public, especially to their stakeholders {Bose, 2020 #6}.

CSR have been studied by scholars and applied by many professionals in the market {Gao, 2016 #8}. While definitions of it vary, CSR has been defined by the European Commission {European Commission,  #21} as a concept whereby corporations seek to achieve social and environmental development by voluntarily integrating CSR into their business operations and interactions wish stakeholders {Dhaliwal, 2014 #15}. Based on this, it could be understood that a corporation's actual expenditure in the CSR sector not only tells its commitment, but also impacts on its business or financial performance with regards to profitability as well as cash flows {Wang, 2015 #19}.

The authors of this article thus try to understand, given the background that the impact that CSR have on corporations might be adverse, the relevance of a corporation's CSR expenditure to its market value performance {Bose, 2020 #3}. A corporation's CSR expenditure could be a potential attraction for shareholders since it is a kind of investment which is not on profit creation but on a corporation's social image and reputation.

The authors use the banking industry in Bangladesh, which is an emerging economy, as the case to study. The reason is mainly that CSR expenditure would be more important, and more impactful in an emerging economy "in terms of poverty alleviation" {The World Bank, 2021 #20}.

The crucial finding is that corporations' CSR expenditure has a positive relevance to their market value which would however cease to increase "after a certain threshold level of CSR expenditure" {Bose, 2020 #3}.

### Critique

First, the authors are qualified researchers in the field of study, and the article is edited, commented, and peer reviewed. All these give accountability and reliability to the article. The researchers noticed one of the key issues in the field, which is that only very few studies have touched upon the subject of the impact a corporation's CSR expenditure have on its market value. This issue is not only theoretically valuable but also provides practical value, since corporations would be able to use the model to estimate the how they should distribute their expenditure into CSR. The study of economics should also focus on the practical side in that it can be tested by time and reality instead of results of experiments.

Furthermore, It is a well constructive article that is supported by relevant literature, reports from the well-designed case study, and it is a worthy contribution to the study not only of CSR, accounting, sustainable development, but also of the field of economics which is a field also strives to answer the questions related to economic sustainability {Ayres, 2008 #31}. This article offers deductive conclusions and gives great insights to what and why managerial roles and corporations should consider incorporating CSR into their business operations which are also supported by a scientific mathematical model.

To evaluate in detail, the article studies the banking industry in Bangladesh, an emerging economy, as its study subject. The researchers give highlight to emerging economies based on the reliable source of The European Central Bank reports. The capital market of CSR expenditure in emerging economies have been studied insufficiently, and the researchers noticed this problem of paucity. And they choose the banking industry because it is one having "high public visibility and accountability" {Bose, 2020 #3}. The banking industry directly depend on society as their main stakeholders as well as shareholders {Wu, 2013 #32}.

The researchers, by retrieving data from a 198-banking firm-year report from 2007 to 2014, draw the conclusion indicating that the more CSR expenditure of banking corporations, the higher their market value, i.e., CSR expenditure has a positive relevance to market value creation. What's more, the study also finds that there is a non-linear association between the two factors. This association is inversely U-shaped curvilinear. To a greater depth, the researchers also found the abnormal CSR expenditure is "positively associated with market value" {Bose, 2020 #3}.

The study process as described above indicate that the researchers have based their study on trustworthy data source, and by using data analysis, they successfully create a model that fits with the reality. The research does not qualitatively improve what was missing in previous literature, but also contribute to the field of study from a quantitative perspective.

The current CSR literature mainly rely on CSR reports or on CSR disclosure scores, which would be to some extent misleading, since CSR accounting and reporting could be used by corporations to build their social image whereas the reporting would focus mainly on corporate strategic development rather than on the actual CSR activities that corporations contribute to the society {Deegan, 2006 #33}. The study also contributes to the current literature by veering off the predominant course of studying the so called "environmentally sensitive" industries, shedding light for corporations that are typically not considered sensitive to the environment.

It is worth mentioning that the researchers differentiate two opposing views that shareholders and stakeholders have. Shareholders are people who are not responsible for corporation operations, and their main interest is the profitability of the corporation in which they invest. So, from shareholders' point of view, what they invest is their expense. The stakeholders, on the other hand, are either directly or indirectly responsible for corporations, thus they are more inclined to think beyond profitability and would care about the potential of corporation value increasing. So, from this viewpoint, higher corporation value can be generated through higher social reputation, which could be largely affected by CSR expenditure. The interest of the two parties are inherently opposing while they indeed share the same interest of profitability. The researchers thus set the variables and apply them by employing the following regression model:

$$
\begin{equation}
M V E_{i, t+\tau=} \beta_{0}+\beta_{1} B V E_{i, t}+\beta_{2} A E_{i, t}+\beta_{3} C S R E X P_{i, t}+\sum Y E A R_{i, t}+\varepsilon_{i, t}
\end{equation}
$$

This model is to determine whether CSR expenditure is relevant to value creation. If the CSR expenditure can provide information in terms of, and is positively related to future expected residual earnings, then it could be deduced that it could generate market value of the corporation. This appliance of regression models and algorithms is a strong indicator that the research is based on empirical and practical theoretical framework instead of pure literature review. To a certain extent, this research is able to be referenced as a guide to measure other industries in emerging economies and could be modified to fit other research projects that investigate CSR expenditure in generating market value.

### Conclusion (not to the article)

The study of economics is, though theoretical in its essence, focused on phenomena and problems in the real world. Economists try to understand, in one way or another, the world through the lens of economic frameworks. The reality, on the other hand, is something that denotes the environment in which we live, and thus it is also economists' job to understand the relationships between economic activities and the effects these activities have on the environment, and to try to theorise them.

The current research on economic development with regards to sustainability has been in short supply {Baumgärtner, 2010 #35}. Most articles were not been able to grasp enough data to investigate the two, and while CSR could be regarded as a good start, the literature in the field has not been able to look beyond regulations over corporations, ignoring that corporations are in essence after profit, as are their stakeholders and shareholders.

It is economists' job to understand how to balance between profitability and social responsibility. The society is complex, and economists are social researchers. To be able to do economic research on sustainability requires more awareness of the urgent need since the environment has been affected by human activity.
