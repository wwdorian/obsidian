### Introduction

This extensive essay aims to compare and contrast two of the chosen personality measures: The Big Five Model and the Myer-Briggs Indicator Type. These two measures are both in essence similar to each other in that one’s personality is being measured against the theory. This essay will examine the Big Five Model in depth and entails my self-assessment through this tool, due to that I believe the MBTI indeed has some shortcomings in that it only classifies people into different groups while ignoring the possible dynamics in character and personality development which would be assessed more accurately by the Big Five Model.

### Literature Review

In this article, the authors referenced all quotes and bodies of information with the correct author(s). And for all the arguments presented in the article, the authors referenced correctly as well as appropriately and listed all the references listed at the end of the article. This article reviewed history within the research field around the topics of personality and values in the workplace, considered recent contributions to the existing study and suggested some areas for future research.

This article draws the conclusion that the current research in the personality and workplace field has shifted its focus from examining if personality tests are worthy of investment to how to maximise its predictive power, and that researchers have found that employees' values would affect largely their job performance, citizenship behaviours and etc which correlate especially with their cultural values (Judge et al., 2013). The authors specifically defined the subtle discrepancy between personality and values, which is that personality tells one's social reputation, while the latter describes one's preferences. The side will be studied here is the former, personality.

Starting from a general but coherent summary of the history of personality study in the workplace, in which the authors presented divided views of personality theory and naturally led to the growing optimism in utilising personality tests in workplace to evaluate employees. Then, the authors focused on the Big Five Personality Traits, and investigated all five traits within the framework, each of which supported by literature, and summarised the links between personality and various workplace attitudes and behaviours, especially the conscientiousness predictor which is the strongest. Thirdly the article pointed out that the concern should be focused on how decision makers, or managers use the information retracted from the test results.

Furthermore, the article is not biased to point our some current issues as well as concerns and suggested areas for future research. Issues such as applicants faking in tests to appear more attractive to employers were discussed and both sides of views were supported by literature, instead of ignoring one side completely.

### Critical Personality Evaluation

MBTI, the abbreviation of the Myer-Briggs Type Indicator, is a widely used approach for both individuals and organisations, which is to analyse human personality and could be used as a questionnaire-based instrument that categorises applicants into 16 types, which are designated Psychological Types (Lloyd, 2012). It is a powerful tool utilised in business, commercial and academic institutions, and the insights it provides to characters and behaviours enhance individuals' ability to interact in a more fruitful way since they can recognise, differentiate, and understand the other person's differences from their own.

The Psychological Types (PTs) are defined through four psychological functions, which are: extroverted/introverted, sensing/intuition, thinking/feeling, perceiving/judging. These four facets are deployed by various companies worldwide to better understand their employees to generate more efficiency and effectiveness in that the companies as organisations need to develop team work, establish structures, and maintain stability (Ware, 2019). Moreover, persons who have understood MBTI framework and what those letters stand for present a better understading of their own behaviours through the lenses of personalities, as well as a broader perspective of those of their families, friends as well as fellow colleagues (Hogan & Holland, 2003).

However, MBTI is, though widely adopted by businesses, given little credibility in academia. Many scholars have doubted the reliability of the MBTI test, one reason for which is that individuals tend to take the test more than once and different results are received every time (Stein & Swan, 2019). Thus many scientists consider the MBTI personality test to be "pseudo-scientific", meaning that it is not science while appearing to be, and suggest that it could be possible that the test cannot depict one's personality as accurately as possible. Therefore many have questioned whether it is suitable or legal to apply the MBTI in business environment.

Another personality measure is the "Big Five", also known as the "Five Factors Model", which dissects one's personality into five measurements, or dimensions: extroversion, agreeableness, openness, conscientiousness and neuroticism. Being reliable to a certain extent, this personality model is a successful attempt to pin down some facets of human characters and is viable in workplace, in which the five traits assessed by the test is widely understood and accepted and are vital in workplace environment. However, there are indeed some researchers doubt whether there are more traits that are undiscovered but might affect individual behaviours, and these researchers argue that the Big Five Model isn't compatible with actual human character traits (Cherry, K. 2019).

A study carried out by McCrae and Costa in 1987 investigated into the difference between the MBTI personality model and the Big Five Model, during which they used the questionnaire methodology and found out that there's a significant parallel relationship, or correlation between these two approaches (McCrae & Costa, 1987). Since both two approaches provide similar insights to personality and to understanding of it, I will choose the Big Five Model to measure my personality and analyse my self-assessment results for this report.

### Self-Assessing & Analysis

Referencing to the Appendix 1, I would present here my self-assessment results based on a list of personality and emotional measures, and I will analyse in detail the results of my Big Five Model test, with the definition of the terms in the model defined by Robbins et al. (2017).

My results show that I:

-   Am excessively open to experience; Tend to be more sociable, talkative and assertive; Derive energy from social interactions.
-   Would rather adjust myself to suit others on issues instead of being stubborn and insisting my own views or ways of doing things.
-   Would get distracted more easily than people who are more conscientious; Am more hedonistic and pursuing many goals in work.
-   Am highly imaginative, sensitive in terms of art, and intellectual; Have a wide range of interests and prefer innovation as well as novelty.
-   Am less emotionally stable; Have a tendency towards regarding things from the negative perspective; Am more possible to feel nervous, anxious and depressed.

To conclude my result and interpret the descriptions above, I am capable or even good at imagination, which means I should, on one hand, take up roles in job that are more related to creativity, and work better with others through strengthening my agreeableness to better cooperate with my colleagues (Clemson et al., 2013). On the other hand, the weaknesses in my personality should also ring me some alert: I should take control of my attention and train my ability to be focused on the tasks that I am at that time working on, and learn to manage my emotions to strengthen my emotional resilience, which requires a deeper understanding of my emotions and this could be assisted by the Big Five Model (Ma’amor et al., 2016).

### Conclusion

In this essay, I have in detail described the Myer-Briggs Indicator Type personality measure and compared it with the Big Five personality model that shed light on my understanding of my roles, strengths as well as weaknesses in the context of workplace. The main results I have reached so far from the research undertaken considering my own personality is to understand the impact I can make, the roles that I fit in, and the possible career path that is not so unfolded before me. My personality has its strong part in terms of originality and creativity, but work requires more than these; it requires diligence and efforts, and the ability to stick to the plan and not swerve away from the main focus. I found that I may suit jobs that are more people oriented and creativity dependent. It is rewarding that I am endowed the chance to express myself more effectively with others and that I am more cooperative in work but I still need to constantly strive to better fit in the mindset that may survive the business world.

From my perspective, the world needs more than ever people with creativity who are not intimidated by the constant and the still accelerating change in the world. The global society as a whole needs architects to take forms of new ideas and new things. I thus would like to have a career in art museums or work as a fashion designer, as well as to be a writer, through which I can make the world something valuable.
