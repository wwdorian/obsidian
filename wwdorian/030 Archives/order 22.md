### Question

“CSR can help both international business and society, including when it comes to conflicts between the two”: Do you agree with this statement? Why, or why not?


### Introduction (1-2 sentences)

Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) has been over at least the last two decades a central topic in sustainability economics, and the term has been widely used by professionals in the workplace {Bose, 2020 #3}. This essay aims to answer the question pertaining to CSR in terms of international business and society, and argues that CSR is positively relevant to both of them, even when conflicts occur between the two {Sardana, 2020 #130}.

### A Definition of CSR, and why

CSR has always been a contested term, and in this essay the definition of it would be a concept according to which corporations incorporate social as well as environmental concerns into businesses, and by means of which interact with stakeholders on a voluntary basis, in that it pointed out the key terms in a clear way, and differentiated stakeholders and shareholders {European Commission, 2006 #21}. It is worth mentioning that shareholders by definition are less responsible for and are less concerned about CSR. Shareholders view CSR expenditure as unnecessary spending at their expenses to satisfy stakeholders, while stakeholders would be more inclined to see CSR expenditure as increasing corporation value {Bose, 2020 #3}. The latter view corresponds with the stakeholder theory {Freeman, 2010 #108}.

### How can CSR contribute to international business? (give examples)

CSR is often related to, and sometimes used interchangeably with, the concept of sustainability both in study and practice {Dhaliwal, 2014 #15}. Sustainability is an idea that can be applied to either the society, the natural environment. or the corporation. It entails, to a certain extent, longevity that every living entity, to which any corporation belongs, would desire. 

Following the idea of longevity, it has been proven that the longer a corporation that trades on a global scale survives to live, the more trusted it is by others in the market, which in turn increases the corporation's market value. It is already a success to survive in the world market, and success is a strong indicator of trustworthiness. However, the majority of current researches only study CSR within a short period of time, and associate CSR to short-term profit, which would be more misleading than to view CSR in the long run, thus is the idea of "CSR longevity". But when considering profit, which is one indicator of corporation financial performance, it turns out the corporations who have performed outstandingly in the market are more likely to perform CSR longevity than others who survived shorter {Porter, 2013 #111}. For instance, Beoing, one of the successful international corporation in the world, has been for years put into efforts in sustainability, in the sense of CSR, by cooperating jointly with their supply chains and by empowering their entire value chain {Kesmodel, 2012 #112}. It is a proof that corporations' engagement in CSR, especially externally, would add to their competitive advantage by strengthening their reputation {Wu, 2013 #32}.

### How can CSR help societies? (give examples)

As the phrase indicates, CSR is closely related to societies. It could be argued that CSR help societies by contributing to the positive feedback in the reciprocal dynamics where corporations interact with societies in which there are shareholders and stakeholders. Unlike shareholders, based on stakeholder theory, stakeholders are, as described above, people who are affecting and are being affected by corporations' operations, decisions, etc, either directly or in an indirect manner. Regarding that the environment where corporations engage is the society, it is no longer the case that corporations are the only ones who benefited from functioning in accordance with sustainability because of its triple bottom line actions, but the case that corporations benefit societies, as well {Idowu, 2014 #116}. Corporations show their social responsibility through maintaining a good relationship with stakeholders and societies, and by empowering employees, promoting goods and services that are environmentally friendly. One of the companies that do this is Starbucks. Starbucks has started using paper straws in plastic straws' stead since 2020 in China, and have been training employees to understand the environment in relation to their services for customers. As a matter of fact, the company already proposed this idea of eliminating plastic straws worldwide {Starbucks Stories & News, 2018 #117}. The company had achieved that objective in Japan {Starbucks Stories & News, 2018 #117}. This example clearly shows one way corporations can contribute to societies in helping restore the environment to previous health and balance.

### How might the interests of business and societies conflict (give examples)?

There will be conflicts between the interests of business and societies, of course. But it is vital to remember that both of them include stakeholders. Stakeholders can include multiple identities, i.e., they might be employees, consumers, host communities, NGOs, governments, etc., each of which has its own role, diverse interests and expect differently from CSR {Idowu, 2014 #116}. These different interests can be given an example as simple as different opinions on what corporations would do. For instance, in China there are some families refuse to move even when constructions are going to be finished, who are known as "Nail Families (NFs)," which means extremely stubborn {ABC News, 2012 #119}.

The interests of the corporation in the construction industry certainly reside in the future payoff of the construction being done, while the NFs regard their property of the land as the most important asset to keep in that it serves their interests. Thus the conflict occur.


### Explain at least one way in which CSR might help resolve such conflicts (give examples), or the reasons that you think it can’t

The conflict occurred due to the differences in both parties' interests. The corporation wanted to maximise their profit, while the other was not satisfied with whatever things that they might want but the corporation do not offer. CSR might be able to help resolve this conflict, in that both parties in the conflict would like to sustain their original plan or previous way of life. The families need to be able to trust the corporation, therefore the corporation must exhibit that trait of trustworthiness, which is not from giving or donating money as compensations, but from CSR accounting and reporting.

The corporation, however, is not going to lose some value in the long run. First, if, through CSR reporting and accounting, the conflict can be resolved, the construction project would be able to on the way to finish, which would later generate value and market share {Porter, 2013 #111}. Secondly, CSR would be able to help the corporation build its reputation, or lift it up, to the extent to which reputation becomes the dominant factor of the corporation's legitimacy. Although it is argued by some scholars that there are an amount of corporations practice CSR for building ethical facades, corporations who show commitments in CSR would receive more understanding from the other party even when their interests differ {Bai, 2019 #109}.


### Conclusion

It is argued in this essay that CSR has the viable function of positively affecting corporations and societies, even when certain conflicts occur due to diverse and maybe opposite interests. This essay made a few examples to elaborate upon topics about how corporations and societies can both be benefited from CSR, and raised a case for conflicts that may be resolved with the help of CSR, alongside CSR accounting and reporting. The essay points out the interconnected nature between corporations and societies, and that one cannot live without the other, suggesting that the complex dynamics between business and society could be led to a positive way by CSR, and disruptions on an international level can be also addressed and mitigated by CSR.
