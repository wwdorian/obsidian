1. Why do you think human beings need to come up with laws, customs and behaviours in order to 'settle' together?

There is in every human being a natural inclination to live together. Recent study has suggested the selection, i.e., natural selection, has shaped us into apes who must cooperate with one another. Cooperation is the foundation of the society, and it often fails when it comes to disagreements. Laws, customs, certain behaviour patterns are aimed to resolve disagreements - instead of differences - to help human beings 'settle' together {Fuentes, 2019 #100}.

2. How does this bring about the other types of sites we will discuss in the following weeks?

Sites of settlement is to help form the structure of societies, but a scaffold without bricks and stones is nothing other than mere decoration. The other types of sites, e.g., sites of ritual, are to fill in the content of cultural contents that would be installed into architectures, which at the end of the day assist the process of bringing people 'settle' living place, problems, disagreements together {Read, 2000 #101}.

3. The examples we discussed this week all use a grid as an organising system. Why do you think it has been so popular in so many different cultures throughout history?

Grids are most common structures when forming living spaces in that this provides two elements in my view. The first is stability. Although triangular shapes are most stable, but it represents to a certain extent conflicts. And conflicts must be settled, to which grids offer the solution. Secondly, grids structures assist management. It would not be easy when ancestors use triangles to manage space, since it would be hard to calculate the area and other data.

4. What do they all have in common?

They all are grids or approximate grids, to begin with. And they are all used in all kinds of sites, including sites of settlement, sites of production, power, etc.

5. In what respects do they differ?

They differ in various ways. Some sites use more grids than other shapes; Some use shapes to exhibit supreme power, while others exhibit democratic power. Some use the structure, i.e., sites to differentiate people, while some others use sites to gather up people.
