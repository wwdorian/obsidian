Shot 1: The police officer is driving at night to check there is not anything wrong in the streets, and the scene goes through time by transitioning from the focusing on the officer to the focusing on the streets (1a). The transition in time is expressed and wrapped in the fading in effect by dimming the the light. There is then a man, who is almost blended in with the environment, approaches closer to the camera, slowly, in a quiet yet seemingly righteous manner (1b). Our focus is then drawn to the man and the direction that he is leading: a shop.

Mise-en-scene:
- low key lighting (129) and soft lighting, street lamp, night (1a and 1b).
- sidelighting (1a), frontal lighting (1b).
- The street lamp is the main source of the lighting, and by it our attention is drawn from the officer to the man who is approaching closer to the camera as well as the store in the frame.

Cinematography:
- 1.6:1 aspect ratio (182).
- Shallow space (1a); deep space (1b).
- Both long take, which leads us to focus on both the officer's face which tells his state of mind, and on the man's manner of movement which intensifies our curiosity as to where he is going and what is his next move.

Editing: cut (217).
