This is where I handle all the current projects. This is my personal North Star.

Projects are given high priority in that they need to be dealt with at the present, each with explicitly defined duration and expected results. There is no place for idleness when executing projects. Anything less actionable, and would require a long duration of time to cultivate, would be in the [[1000 Areas]] section.

My projects are listed according to my intuition that tells me about each's importance. But there might be something to say about the list.

Right, I also would like very much to take a #journal possibly everyday, but it depends. Sometimes just don't get the time. Maybe taking 5 minutes every morning to write journals would be a great idea. [[Habits are cultivated]], aren't they? But why?

Why should I do it? Well, writing is such a way to explore my inner world, where many are hidden from my conscious eyes. To connect with my deeper self, or just even to reflect upon some things, writing would help me gain clarity and strength. It is how I express myself to the world, and most importantly, to me myself: I wonder what I can be, and what I want to be, and thus it becomes a prerequisite to explore myself.
