The new communication technologies erupt in the 21st century, and has been transforming in every area of the workplace, and this transformation does not only include individual users of these technologies - but organisations are also impacted. The collaboration in the workplace requires fast and responsive systems to promote the efficiency and effectiveness of the information deliver process, as the workplace is continually shaped into a more networked state and repetitive work would be a disaster for creative collaboration {Musa, 2015 #853}. In the fields of both arts and social sciences, especially, new technologies have been introduced into the work environment and facilitate the progress of these two fields, in terms of the size, quantity, and quality of information {Edinyang, 2012 #855}. Evidences could be revealed by recent studies on the framework being developed to manage these systems {Nguyen, 2019 #854}. Also, examples of communication technologies used in education of social sciences, for example, has been proven as managing the education process with higher degree of effectiveness and autonomy {Edinyang, 2012 #855}. With these and other examples and discussions, this essay would investigate the evolution of modern communication technologies and their practices in transforming and transmuting the arts and social sciences.
