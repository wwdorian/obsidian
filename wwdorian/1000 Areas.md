My areas are what I would need so much time and effort to cultivate. I always think of cultivation as the only way to meaningful growth. In some sense, humanity has culture because we cultivated; culture by root means to work, as working is cultivating.

The real problem then, is when I would really have time to carry out this. Well, every possible moment. Every moment counts, since [[our life is short]]. 

Personally, I would like to cultivate all those concepts which I can utilise to interpret and understand the world. The truth lies not in themselves. The reason that humanity can evolve to such a stage in history is partly that human beings interpret the world around them, using philosophy, science, religion, ideologies, etc, and all in all, when using a single word to describe them, concepts. In conceptualisation of our interpretation of the world, many new ideas, understandings, and others **emerge**.

This is also exactly why zettelkasten works so well. Emergence. New understandings emerge as they evolve in the system with connections to many other concepts that may or may not in the same or similar fields as they are.
