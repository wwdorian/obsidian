Angels, or utopias, can be both considered as 'models'. Models for thought could be used to compare the reality with the ideal in mind, thus to build upon the reality the imagined ideal could become possible. That is one absolutely great ability of human - we can imagine. However [[the idea of angel was not invented by philosophers]]

It is fun to say that we can image and that partly make us homo sapiens. Since no other animals, reportedly or allegedly can think of things that do not exist in reality, or in the here and now. Language is by itself an example. What I am writing are based on scenes in my mind, which I cannot either touch nor see in front of my eyes. Yet, still, I am able to express my thoughts upon these things.

But back to the point. Angels are, by itself, a metaphor, used to embody something - for example, greatness. Humans strive for greatness, and in order to get there, sometimes we need some figures who are already there to represent what we want to become. In this view whether angels exist or not doesn't matter any more, since the possibility that we can become great, and what the would-be greatness looks like are conceivable to us - then we can march forward.

Celestial beings or anything celestial do not mean necessarily that there is a world out there that is both wonderful and holy and .... etc. It can simply be an ideal for which we fight. [[how important is the Great Conversation#^e6af71|We live only here and now]], and we want to live better, not only in material aspects.

> Whether such beings exist or not, the fact that they are conceivable has significance for theory and analysis. Those who do not believe in the existence - or even the possible existence - of utopias nevertheless regard them as fictions useful analytically in appraising accepted realities. What an ideal society would be like can be considered apart from the question of its existence; and so considered, it functions as an hypothesis in political and economic thought. What sort of being an angel would be if one existed can likewise serve as an hypothesis in the examination of a wide variety of theoretical problems.
