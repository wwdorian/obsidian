### influenced by religious symbolism

The image that we have of an "angel" is influenced by religious symbolism which is a long tradition that has been followed by various painters and poets - there may be other creatives that have followed it. But does this image solely influenced by religions? I suspect that possibility. However I have to admit that it is the image that first entered into my mind when I see the word. That could be influenced by propaganda such as TV shows or films, etc.

> Influenced by a long tradition of religious symbolism in painting and poetry, our imagination responds to the word "angel" by picturing a winged figure robed in dazzling white and having the bodily aspect of a human being.
