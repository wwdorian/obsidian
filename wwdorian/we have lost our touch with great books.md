The world is losing touch with their great books which are their tradition and heritage, in the West of course, but what about the East? People worldwide are not accessing their ancestors' wisdom (this of course presupposes that they did have wisdom and is provable). This deviation (if it could be called as one) does worth some serious consideration.

> Until lately the West has regarded it as self-evident that the road to education lay through great books.
