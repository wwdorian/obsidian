"The Great Conversation" is a judgmental phrase coined by the writer of the first volume of *The Great Books of Western World* to conceptualise the way in which the western civilisation inherits their ancestors' wisdom and ways of thinking.

It covers:
1. [[why do we read great books]]
2. [[what is the Great Conversation]]
3. [[how important is the Great Conversation]]
4. [[contemporary problems]]
