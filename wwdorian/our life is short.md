Greetings, everyone. 

I thought of writing this when I was browsing my [obsidian](https://obsidian.md) vault.

I was wondering whether I would have enough time to learn everything that I like? I mean, time is itself limited in supply; my energy is no exception. Besides, I would rather reckon that time is not a resource that is to be managed, arranged, segmented. It is just passing us by. We are the audience, and time is only a passerby. We do not pass time; it passes us.

So that would be an alert. If I am not in control of time, what can I, possibly, have power over then? Too much thoughts on this would cause [[paralysis by analysis]], definitely. But not thinking of this would trigger [[extinct by instinct]], which is even a more fatal consequence. To judge the right or wrong of this question would then require ethical theories. [[value ethics]]? Or [[consequentialism]]? Or rather [[deontology]]?

So, the only way to get rid of this problem is to regard there shall be no such a judgment, i.e., to see the inherent value that actions hold, themselves. I have been a person who always think through before I take any risk - well, maybe not in a strictly defined sense. But that, oh, reminds me of [[Hamlet]].
