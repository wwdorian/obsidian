Organising is deciding where decisions will be made, who will do what jobs and tasks, and who will work for whom in the company.

It concerns about _what ways should things get done?_

e.g. In the retail industry, staffing levels should match to customer traffic, for the purpose of [[efficiency]].

### An example - Walmart's software for schedule

Walmart recently implemented software to match the schedules of its 2.2 million associates with the flows of its 260 million weekly customers. While this dynamic, just-in-time approach sounds like a great idea, it resulted in highly fragmented schedules for thousands of store employees who could be sent home from work after just a few hours (due to unexpectedly slow customer traffic) or called back unexpectedly (when customer traffic increased). These unpredictable work schedules, which effectively put many associates perpetually on call, produced backlash from employees, advocacy groups and unions alike. In response, Walmart reconfigured its schedules using three types of shifts: open, fixed and flex. Managers schedule open shift employees during times that they previously indicated that they would be available for. Fixed shifts, which are offered first to long-time employees, guarantee the same weekly hours for up to a year. Finally, flex shifts let employees build their own schedules in two- to three-week blocks. Walmart is also developing an app that will allow employees to view, update and set their schedules using a smartphone. Walmart managers have high hopes for the new shift structures, which reduced absenteeism by 11 per cent and employee turnover by 14 per cent during a two-year test.
