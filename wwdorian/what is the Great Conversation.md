[[the Great Conversation]] [[we have lost our touch with great books|with which we have lost our touch]] could be seen as the Western tradition and heritage. And since it is the tradition, it needs to be evaluated through the modern lenses; since it is the heritage, it needs to be re-accessed and passed on to the next generation including the current one.

> It is the task of every generation to reassess the tradition in which it lives, to discard what it cannot use, and to bring into context with the distant and intermediate past the most recent contributions to [[the Great Conversation]]. This set of book is the result of an attempt to reappraise and re-embody the tradition of the West for our generation.
