### Why do we study organisational behaviour?

Because it provides insights which enhance our abilities to improve the effectiveness of an organisation - meanwhile the efficiency since these two ideas always come hand in hand.

So in three words: _understand_ -> _predict_ -> _influence_ organisational events.

> A field of study that investigates the impact that individuals, groups and structure have on behaviour within organisations, for the purpose of applying such knowledge toward improving an organisation's effectiveness.

### Why study? Why not just intuition?

Because intuitions are gut feelings, based on individual observation and are subject to common sense, which may be erroneous or partial in certain circumstances.

While systematic study would look at relationships among elements, would be supported by scientific evidence and can more accurately predict the future to which the organisation is heading.

### Shaping & Predicting OB

Independent variables (X): presumed cause of change in dependent variables (Y)
Dependent variables (Y): response to change in independent variables (X)

There are 3 levels of X: individual, group, and organisation systems
- Individual:
	- biographical characteristics
	- personality and emotions
	- values and attitudes
	- ability
	- perception
	- motivation
	- individual learning
	- individual decision making
- Group:
	- communication
	- group decision making
	- leadership and trust
	- group structure
	- conflict
	- power and politics
	- work teams
- Organisation systems:
	- organisational culture
	- human resource policies and practices
	- organisational structure & design

The followings are Y which is what managers need to understand, predict and influence:

-   Productivity: performance measure that includes effectiveness + efficiency: efficiency = the ration of effective output to input
-   Job satisfaction: general attitude towards one's job - difference between amount of reward (workers receive) and amount they believe (they should receive)
-   Organisational citizenship behaviour/OCB: discretionary behaviour that is not part of formal job requirements, but which nevertheless promotes effective functioning of organisations
-   Deviant workplace behaviour: voluntary behaviour that violates significant organisational norms
-   Absenteeism: failure to report to work
-   Turnover: voluntary and involuntary permanent withdrawal from the organisation

However, there's also the need to consider **contingency/situational factors** (Z).
