### great books provide perspectives and are retrievable data of experiences/lessons learnt

The idea is plain and simple: these books would help us solve our problems. There's nothing new in the sun. And to be frank, one basic part of intelligence is marked by its retrieval of past knowledge, in the sense of which we should be regarded as morons by the fact that we stopped learning from our wise predecessors. History - origin - problem - solution - intelligence - now everything connects.

> We do not think that these books will solve all our problems. We do not think that they are the only books worth reading. We think that these books shed some light on all our basic problems, and that it is folly to do without any light we can get. We think that these books show the origins of many of our most serious difficulties.
