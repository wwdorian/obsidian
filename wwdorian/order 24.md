### Questions in the Article

This article, written by Janice L {Taylor, 2013 #534}. Taylor, is a qualitative study that aims to investigate the topic of teacher retention in the United States (the US) in general. This issue of teacher recruitment and retention is prevalent and influencing many aspects of the country's education, in that it poses teachers with numerous challenges in classroom, as well as pushing teachers to meet the standards of accountability in states and the country. The author mainly studies the African American teachers' retention issue in this article in order to provide the related context for this study. There has been ongoing decrease over the past two decade of  African American teachers, while there is also a positive growth of minority teachers entering the teaching field that is rated as much as twice the growth rate of white teachers {Ingersoll, 2011 #536}. Thus, the author argues that the stability of African American teachers' professional career has been dropping in rate. There are many factors that caused this phenomenon, as has been revealed by the author in the article.

This article, therefore, tries to investigate, understand, and answer the question of what are the factors contributing to, or influencing teacher retention, and how it should be done by schools as well as education administrations to better retain their teachers, especially the minority teachers, for example, African American teachers. The article thus is focused on a closer inspection of these minority teachers' teaching experiences and their resilience which possibly has an impact on the result of their retention, in which the concept of resilience is defined as a capability that enables the teachers to better adapt to their constantly changing environment, i.e., the classrooms, and that strengthens their competency towards adverse conditions that contribute to the situation of teachers' leaving. Question made by the author then can be summarised as what the four African American teachers' experience are, during the desegregation in the South of the US, and what facets of the positive effects brought by resilience have are, during the desegregation.

### Rationale, or the Literature Review of the Study

The rationale upon which the study is based is multifaceted. The author constructs the theoretical framework for this study by using various theories across fields, which includes Resilience Theory, and the Black Feminist Theory.

The Resilience Theory is a complex that is made up of eight elements which consists of religion, one's ability to react to adverse situations in a positive way, autonomy, commitment, relationships, and others {Polidore, 2004 #538}. This theoretical framework is highly relevant to the study carried out by the author, in that it is worth considering of a person's resilience in face of high pressure and a constant changing environment, as well as the adverse situations that the minority teachers had faced before and during the desegregation, while the person is still capable of being there and retaining his or her profession. The Resilience Theory are based on two premises, one of which is that resilience is an ability, instead of capability. That is, resilience is more of a trait that is and is responsive to a person's development in character, than a fixed characteristic that has been innate within a person after birth {Walsh, 2014 #541}. The other premise is that a person is reactive and is constantly shaping as well as shaped by his or her external world, i.e., the society, the milieux, and other environmental factors, such as the school, family, working conditions, etc {Walsh, 2014 #541}. The author employed this theory, proved and reviewed its originality.

The second pillar of the author's theoretical framework is the Black Feminist Theory, which the author refers to as the securing stone for the foundation of the framework {Taylor, 2013 #534}. The Black Feminist Theory was defined as the process with one's own awareness of one's conflicting battle with other views in the world that treats men and women differently, and was thus defined to the extent to which it exemplifies the possible harmony between the two biological sexes in the world, as well as to which it provides such a means towards that goal of ultimate harmony in the world {Collins, 1989 #540}. Moreover, as is also more important, that adopting the Black Feminist Theory enables African American women to have a ground upon which their voices can be valued with their uniqueness. That it, it provides and ensures the validity of their voices. With such validating and empowering, the author could actually assist these women assimilate their voices into the discourse of the field of study. The author's rationale of this article could be then regarded as justified and referenced.

### Methodology Employed by the Study

The research is mainly within the fields of study of education, desegregation, psychology, African American, and discourse analysis. Through discourse analysis of the four African American teachers' voices validated for research, the author employs the method of historical biography, with the support from the research technique of narrative inquiry. The author used such a methodology as mentioned above to investigate how the four African American teachers react to their teaching experiences, and how their inner resilience was developed and strengthened along the way before, during, and after desegregation in the South which enabled them to be staying in the teaching profession. The author also used semi-structured interviews to help the four African American teachers re-experience and retell their stories {Taylor, 2013 #534}.

The narrative inquiry technique is a viable and practical tool for research when the voices of the four teachers are validated, and can give it momentum to further investigation. This technique involves both the researcher and the informant, and thus it is not only a way of involvement, but a way of evolution, in the sense that this evolution is in juxtaposition with the country's development from the perspective of history, and thus in line with the historical biography method, eventually validating the research {Connelly, 1990 #542}. 

### Epistemology of the Study

The author is mainly interested in education theories and application, as well as the disciplines of teacher retention, teacher resilience, and teacher efficacy which are included in the teaching theories and practices, where the author conducts related research. The article reveals that the author is in the paradigm of pragmatism, realism. and interpretivism. The reasons for this observation is based on the fact that the author stresses the discourse of the four retired African American teachers, and incorporated them into analysis while also stands from a social point of view, and the author's adoption of the historical biography indicates that the author put the research processes as well as the results in a specific historical context within which the study is valuable not only to the field of education but also to other subjects. This quality of this qualitative research could also be thus verified.

### Context Described Satisfactory Level

Qualitative study celebrates the importance of context. The author provides in the article sufficient details of physical, cultural, social, and environmental context in which the research was carried out. The author traveled to where the study occurs, which is a rural community in the South, where there have been historical events such as a sit-in in opposition of the segregation in public schools of the local community. Provided with such knowledge, the author conducts her study with authenticity, reliability, and integrity. The context of the article is, thus, highly satisfactory, and the results of the research can be transferred to other settings of study.

### Data Collection and Analysis

The author provided enough information in the article for understanding the situation in which the analysis and data collection processes are carried out. The processes the author provided and described are detailed to the extent to which other researchers can have a sense of how it evolves continually. The author and the informants, who are the four retired African American female teachers, made up the research team. The four teachers were chosen for a deeper investigation and understanding of the teacher retentionability problem as well as of the current situation, instead of serving the purpose for generalisation for the convenience of empirical study {Taylor, 2013 #534}.

The four chosen teachers were selected with the criterion that all four of them had taught in the school where the research was carried out, and that they had continued teaching even after desegregation until they resigned or retired from the school. Also, the data collection process was granted permissions by the four chosen teachers, who volunteered to be informants of the study. The data thus is viable for study.

With the instrument of narrative inquiry, and the method of historical biography, the author analyses the data collected for discovering underlying themes of resilience with the support from the theorical background of the Black Feminist Theory. The author employs three different methods to approach and to categorise the collected voices from the teachers, including authoritative, supportive, and interactive {Taylor, 2013 #534}. The author also uses the narrative inquiry method to identify what the four informants' voices deliver, where they differ, what they share in common, and to what extent their voices are with resilience development embedded.

The author also uses cross-case analysis to assist her carrying out the study, which is used to incorporate all the emerged themes in terms of resilience, and to establish themes in the context and the theoretical framework of the study.

The data collection and analysis processes are thus viable for reaching the conclusions and for future research.

### Interpretation, and the Reflexivity of the Article

The research is valid and reliable in terms of its interpretation and reflexivity. As a qualitative research, this research collected sufficient data, in the forms of audio taped recordings of interviews, and of the member checking strategies, along with others such as peer review, triangulation and trustworthiness, as well as reflexivity in that the author is herself a daughter of an African American woman {Taylor, 2013 #534}. With the help of the consistency of the collected data, and the uniqueness of the study, the author provides the results of the study with meeting the dependability criterion. This article is thus a credible source of information and could be transferred to other disciplines of research.

### Readability

This qualitative research is with high readability, in that it provides information included in the article with sufficient data, analyses, and explanations as well as elaborations. The results of this research is listed out in a manner that is clear and meeting the criteria of mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive when judging the authenticity and reliability of a research article. The data collected are also in the article with a high degree of reflection and analyses with in-depth discussions.

### Relevance of the Reached Conclusion

The relevance is high in terms of the reached conclusion. The author employs qualified methodology and incorporate thorough data analyses, which improves the relevance of the first-hand data to the research. The results are reached by coherent and cohesive understanding of the subject as well as the application of the methodology, which enhances the relevance of the conclusion to the research, too.

### Contribution of the Research

The author increases the value of the research by further investigating the idea of resilience in terms of application, and provides potential solutions to the teacher retention problem with regards to autonomy and positive relationships. The research is also highly of value in that it offers validated voices of African American female teachers who have had experienced the period of desegregation, and who are the informants of the article, which in return furthers the field of study with accountable data and conclusions.
