Key points in writing:
1. read & break down assignment questions
	- determine the topic/title
	- identify key words
2. Shannon and Weaver 1949 - the Information Theory
	- Sender - Receiver
	- Encoding and Decoding
	- Message and Channel
	- Feedback and Noise


So, what I could generate from today's meeting are:
1. It is vital to understand what the task requires.
	- All requirements are to be met since not adhering to those may cause loss of marks.
	- Requirements provide information that may help the pre-writing and the writing process.
2. Formats are to be understood and prepared.
3. Key words should be highlighted as they would help understand the field of study as well as materials that we would use in writing.
4. in writing it should not be ignored to refer to **learning outcomes** as well as **marking criteria**.
