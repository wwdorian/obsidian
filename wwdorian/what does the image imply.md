The deduction here by the author requires that:

1.  Humans are characterised by intelligence.
2.  Wings as an image are related to messengers.
3.  Angels are in essence spiritual - they do not take actual bodies in the sense of forms - body is a form - Plato's cave allegory(?) - which is challenged by the idea that [[angels are people's imagination by Hobbes]].
4.  Hobbes' idea was challenged by Locke though: [[angel-spirit as a layer of qualities of the mind]]

> The human appearance suggests that angels, like men, are persons; that they are most essentially characterised by their intelligence. The wings suggest the function of angels - their service as messengers from God to man. The aura of light which surrounds them signifies, according to established conventions of symbolism, the spirituality of angels. It suggests that to imagine angels with bodies is to use a pictorial metaphor.
