Planning is determining organisational goals and a means for achieving them.

Simply put, [[planning]] is about a goal, and a method to reach that goal.

It is connected with determination as well as vision. However, if hesitation takes control in planning, it would lead only to [[paralysis by analysis|analysis paralysis]]

The key point in planning is **clarity**.
A plan that's successful _eventually_
should be clear _initially_.

### An example - Cisco Systems strayed from its core business

Cisco Systems, maker of the critical computer routers and switches that run the Internet and create high-speed networks in offices and homes, strayed from its core networking business by spending $ 34 billion acquiring or developing consumer products, such as Pure Digital, which made the once-popular Flip camera; Kiss Technology, which made networked DVD players; and Umi, a  $600 video conference service for homes that came with a $25 monthly charge for video access. Longtime CEO John Chambers has admitted that Cisco lost its focus and that going forward its priorities will be its core business: 'leadership in core routing, switching, and services; collaboration; date centre virtualisation and cloud; architectures; and video'. Accordingly, Cisco has now shut down its Flip, Kiss and umi divisions.
