### Ideas

I decided to take up what I've left reading: The [[1002 Great Books of the Western World MOC|Great Books of the Western World]] (GBWW).

The initial idea was really simple: I want to have some knowledge that could be instantly available to me and could provide me with time-enduring wisdom and insight. The set of books were edited for that reason.

What about Chinese masterpieces? To be honest, I do love Eastern wisdom. The only problem is that I am unable to read them in a flow as I can do to the Western, the latter is in comprehensible English, at least.

Simply put, I am still testing the idea of identifying myself with classic Eastern societal values.
