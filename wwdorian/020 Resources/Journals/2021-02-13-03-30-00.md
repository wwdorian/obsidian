### Ideas

So, today I learnt something as was told from my girlfriend, Cyrielle. I met Cyrielle from a casual chitchat when I ran into Samira, her French teacher at university. That was 2 years ago. Considering our age, we are quite alike in both character and things we like. But when it comes to the understanding of life and other people, I fall far behind.

She told me tonight that I was used to thinking of myself as the 'sun' when meeting and interacting with others. The truth is, I am not the 'sun'. I guess it is somewhat... something about 'boy's ego'. Since a boy likes to reckon himself as the centre of the universe. Truly, it occurred to me that I am still on the road to maturity.

I calmed down, and thought about what she said. The reason why I was like that isn't because I think I'm superior to every one. It would rather be: my focus is not on the others, the people who are just like me - humans. My focus was solely on myself. And that's where arrogance and nervousness came from. Caring others isn't something shameful; it is actually power. That what I should learn and continue to learn from now on.
