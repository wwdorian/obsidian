### Supply Chain Resilience

Today, global networks made up of supply chains (SCs) are, designed and constructed to deliver goods and services,  serving every single corporation in the world, amidst all the unpredictable factors in the local and global market {Kochan, 2018 #88}. In the face of such uncertainties, the traditional risk management strategies are not able to handle the potential disruptions, and thus the idea of supply chain resilience (SCRES) is introduced into supply chain management, in order to enable and empower SCs to react better to risks and disruptions, and to manage SCs in a more effective manner.

### Why It Is An Imperative for Australian Companies

Australia is now facing the COVID-19 pandemic. Causing a tremendous wave of unemployment, this pandemic has shrank the economy which have avoided recession for four years {Schlumbohm, 2020 #89}. This phenomenon applies as well to the SCs, without which corporations would not be able to generate value during the pandemic as they previously would be. Furthermore, as the country relies heavily on services which depend on SCs to deliver efficiently and effectively, the pandemic has demanded SCRES if the country and corporations are to function during the crisis. And this pandemic is only one of many disruptions in various forms. Thus the Australian federal government issued a Supply Chain Resilience Initiative (SCRI) on 1 October in order to manage this situation {Future Food Systems, 2020 #85}.
