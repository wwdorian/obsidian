1. Olivia has been with May for 2 years, although May had broke up with for 3 months last September. And, even though Olivia describes May as her best friend, saying she is perfect: outgoing, funny, seeming too cool to hang out, recently May have been leaving her out to hang out with others, and it makes her feel bad.
2. May recently told Olivia that she has become more clingy. Olivia feels stressed lately, feeling lost after future graduation from environmental science.
3. The reason Olivia feels that May is going to break up with her is that May seemed reluctant when she offered to move in together, while May currently lives with her parents. And lately May often told her that she was too "busy" to spend time with her. May used to be supportive with everything, and had been keeping her on track with basically everything.
4. Olivia started her first relationship at 15 which lasted for 9 months, and later with her second girlfriend for roughly 2 years, which ended close to the time she started high school. She then went to Georgia, who was her first proper relationship. The relationship lasted for also about 2 years. After that relationship ended, she met May.
5. Olivia doesn't have many friends. She still regards May as her best friend, but since childhood she felt not understood by other people, including those who hung out with. While at primary school, she had a friend Tory, who has quite a dramatic personality. She would approach other people, but they seem not that interested. She used to catch up with friends, including some close ones, from high school, but that also seems to have ended.
6. Olivia doesn't have any siblings contrary to May, who has a nice family. Olivia's parents separated when she was 15. She never had the chance to see her father's parents, since both passed away before She was born. She had limited connection with her father, and even that connection stopped after her father found a job. Olivia felt increasingly awkward to interact with her father in that they do not have much in common. Her father was basically absent, which she referred as the house didn't feel like home even when everyone was present.
7. The relationship between Olivia and her mother has been generally positive; they now still text message each other every day, and also have been trying to meet each other. However, her mother has so strong expectations of her that Olivia cannot talk about anything grade-related. She believed her father had some depression too.
8. Olivia's mother has depression, which was diagnosed soon after her birth while her mother was still relatively young. Her mother would sometimes not get out of bed for days - which Olivia describes as "like a zombie" - because of she was experiencing "episodes". Because of this, Olivia had to entertain herself.

Olivia is a 23-year-old woman being transferred by herself to the university counsellor, worrying her girlfriend May might break up with her. From the assessments, Olivia was born in a family where her parents weren't forming a secure environment for her growth, and after their separation Olivia was living with her mother who was diagnosed with depression making she must look after herself, leading her later dependent on others' attention to validate herself, which could explain her SRES results of being low self-esteemed, as well as her constant contact with her mother in university. Her social and romantic relationships have been unsteady, her life not centred towards a goal, and her personality is currently not unified. These explain her worries of her girlfriend's possible leaving in that the only validations she received were from her grade and May's support. In all, she belongs to the Anxious-Ambivalent attachment style, which explains her seemingly nonchalance in the interview towards the topic of her worries, and which explains her small social circle since what she really looks after is a caregiver, in this case to be May.

Francis Galton proposed the concept and theory of "nature versus nurture", in 1869 {Collins, 2000 #136}. By definition, "nature" is a term referring to the biological aspect of human beings, related to some concepts such as genetics. On the other hand, "nurture" focuses on the developmental aspects: parenting, action, the environment where a person is being raised, etc {Meyer, 2013 #137}. Bowlby incorporated these two ideas into his own work and developed the attachment theory, which describes the dynamics that close interpersonal bonds perform on one's identity, as well as his or her sense of acceptance and security. Although initially these ideas and the attachment theory were employed to study infants, they later on prove to be as effective on adults.

Therefore, what could be concluded from this case are, using the attachment theory while considering nature and nurture issues, that Olivia have been avoidant in terms of attachment with her mother. Her mother was reported to be diagnosed with depression, and her parents were both unavailable physically and emotionally, with father being absent and mother being ill. It could be concluded that her parents were detached and disengaged. These point to her behaviours indicating avoidant attachment style supported by the nature theory {Wright, 2020 #135}. Her mother's depression has certain impact on her depression scale. Moreover, considering that Olivia continues presenting behaviours indicating inability to openly talk about her emotions, and connecting this with the nurture theory, Olivia's attachment style is also affected by her milieux, for example, her mother's ignoring her while in depression episodes, and her father's absence as well as disconnection. Low social support on social situations where conflicts occur would contribute to instability and insecurity for infants who will later on require more needs in the psychological aspect {Felton, 2013 #138}.

In this case, thus, Olivia's lack of support from her parents would invalidate her needs while she needed to be recognised and loved. This leads to her later seemingly anxious attachment style in relationships, whether it is friendship or romantic ones, in this case to be with May. Reportedly she has grown constant dependency on May, and this could be explained by her nurture factors. And these point to her emotional detachment and rejection of others, her feeling hurt and angry with her family while on the face behaving nonchalantly.

Conclusively, both factors, nature and nurture, have contributed to Olivia's attachment styles which affects her attitudes and behaviours towards others, including her friends, lovers, and family. But it could be concluded that it is the nurture part that affects more on her relationships and her constant seeking for support from others.
