Controlling is monitoring progress towards goal achievement and taking corrective action when progress isn't being made.
In short, Controlling is to monitor if the plan is ineffectively/inefficiently carried out, and if there's something wrong with [[planning]], [[organising]], and [[leading]].

The basic control process involves setting standards to achieve goals, comparing actual performance to those standards, and then making changes to return performance to the standards you set.

### An example - Jetstar charges customers for extras

To maintain low-priced airfares and cut costs, budget carrier Jetstar charges customers for what they call 'extras'. Food and drink are optional extras that can be paid for online when booking or on board, along with entertainment and comfort packs containing pillows and blankets. For an additional fee, customers can also reserve a window or aisle seat, or a seat with extra legroom. A surcharge for checked-in luggage (starting at around $50 for a domestic flight in Australia) also controls expenditure.
