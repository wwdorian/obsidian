It is common for anyone that have heard of the word "angel" to picture such an image. But an image is a concretisation of some abstract ideas; virtualisation. Abstraction is a way reverse; it is abstraction of something concrete, something that takes a physical form. That would lead to the problem of how we define what has some actual form and what not. So, do angels really exist? Or maybe they are like numbers; they can't be seen or touched or sensed through our body, but they do exist. There are possibilities that could be investigated further.

Angel is itself an abstraction of qualities, but also is a concretisation of this abstraction.

> This image, common to believers and unbelievers, contains features which represent some of the elements of meaning in the abstract conception of angels as this is found in the writings of Jewish and Christian theologians and in related discussions by the philosophers.
