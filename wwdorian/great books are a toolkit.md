### great books are a toolkit

Great books are themselves a toolkit that, unlike those nowadays so-called "once and for all" books, provide their readers with better understanding of the world by offering the mindsets contained in them.
It's never about **what** were written in them, since information may get outdated.
But that **how** they were conceived of really matters, since by incorporating those ways of thinking into our cognitive process would in large measure lead us to the essence of things because they had been proven by these books themselves.

> We think that the spirit they represent and the habit of mind they teach are more necessary today than ever before. We think that the reader who does his best to understand these books will find himself led to read and helped to understand other books. We think that reading and understanding great books will give him a standard by which to judge all other books.
