### Influenced by Religious Symbolism
The image that we have of an "angel" is influenced by [[religious symbolism]] which is a long tradition that has been followed by various painters and poets - there may be other creatives that have followed it. But does this image solely influenced by religions? I suspect that possibility. However I have to admit that it is the image that first entered into my mind when I see the word. That could be influenced by propaganda such as TV shows or films, etc.

> Influenced by a long tradition of religious symbolism in painting and poetry, our imagination responds to the word "angel" by picturing a winged figure robed in dazzling white and having the bodily aspect of a human being.

### Abstraction and Concretisation - What Do We Mean by "Real"
It is common for anyone that have heard of the word "angel" to picture such an image. But an image is a concretisation of some abstract ideas; virtualisation. Abstraction is a way reverse; it is abstraction of something concrete, something that takes a physical form. That would lead to the problem of how we define what has some actual form and what not. So, do angels really exist? Or maybe they are like numbers; they can't be seen or touched or sensed through our body, but they do exist. There are possibilities that could be investigated further.

Angel is itself an abstraction of qualities, but also is a concretisation of this abstraction.

> This image, common to believers and unbelievers, contains features which represent some of the elements of meaning in the abstract conception of angels as this is found in the writings of Jewish and Christian theologians and in related discussions by the philosophers.

### What does the Image Imply?

The deduction here by the author requires that:

1.  Humans are characterised by intelligence.
2.  Wings as an image are related to messengers.
3.  Angels are in essence spiritual - they do not take actual bodies in the sense of forms - body is a form - Plato's cave allegory(?) - which is challenged by the idea that [[angels are people's imagination by Hobbes]].
4.  Hobbes' idea was challenged by Locke though: [[angel-spirit as a layer of qualities of the mind]]

> The human appearance suggests that angels, like men, are persons; that they are most essentially characterised by their intelligence. The wings suggest the function of angels - their service as messengers from God to man. The aura of light which surrounds them signifies, according to established conventions of symbolism, the spirituality of angels. It suggests that to imagine angels with bodies is to use a pictorial metaphor.


### The Aura of Light: Indication of Illuminations - Greatness v.s. Success

The aura of light when we conceive the image of angels in our minds may be regarded in another view: its functions, instead of its symbolic meanings. Humans have longed for illuminations which in its word root implies 'light'. We often talk about the 'insight', and refer to it as 'muse', a goddess that enlightens us in creation. And this habit of us implies that we may not think that our intelligence is **inborn** in us by our merit, but is rather **installed** by Heaven, which, whatever it is, is something beyond our comprehension as well as us ourselves. We may not think that angels and God or any other celestial beings are real, i.e. existed, but our discussions about our lives and basically every other part of it may have been seen from this perspective, i.e. greatness.

It could be argued that nowadays people do not long for 'greatness', at least not in its sense a few decades ago. People wish for 'success', instead. Greatness implies to some extent one's integrity and character, both of which are not observable from the exterior directly. However, one's success could be so observable that it could even be quantified by some definition.

So, which do I want? Which should I want?

> Another interpretation might be put upon this aura of light if one considers the role which the notion of angel has played in the history of thought. Wherever that notion has entered into discussions of God and man, of matter, mind, and soul, of knowledge and love, and even of time, space, and motion, it has cast light upon these other topics. The illumination which has been and can be derived from the idea of angels as a special kind of being or nature is in no way affected by doubts or denials of their existence.
