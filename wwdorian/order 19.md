Objectives:
1. appraisal of risk **problems**, in particular business risk situations, from a multi-dimensional perspective.
2. reinforce the notion that risk is context-specific.
3. risk management is predicated on a socially constructed reality of the world.
4. a holistic approach.
5. use the dynamic system analysis technique to model a risk situation or risk management problem in business.

### Requirements

1. describe, with the aid of a diagram, the context in which the problem being investigated is embedded.
	1. the surrounding factors, which, arguably, would have affected the way the risk problem has emerged.
	2. the interactions between these factors which could change the relational dynamics leading to the further development of the problem.
	3. indicate how you have obtained the information needed to understand the risk context.
2. use the technique of systems modelling, characterise the problem situation selected as a complex dynamic system by tracing the interdependency relationships between the key variables and nurturing conditions under which the risk would most likely occur.
	1. justify all identified causal links between the key variables and nurturing conditions surrounding the occurrence of the risk situation.
3. based on the system developed to represent the risk situation, systematically assess the level of control, uncertainty and risk potential embedded in each of the key variables and nurturing conditions perceived to give rise to the risk situation
	1. assess the degree of control, levels of residual uncertainty, and growth potential pertaining to each of the key variables and nurturing conditions perceived to be antecedents of the risk situation being considered.
4. use the results of the assessment conducted under task 3, derive one appropriate risk management measure, which may be applied to reduce the risk involved.
	1. rationalise the merits of the proposed measure by drawing on the various schools of thought discussed in the risk management doctrines provided in Hood et al.
5. if the proposed measure is likely to reduce or manage the perceived risk, assess whether the intended action is likely to create a new risk situation.
	1. if so, examine whether any new measure(s) has to be adopted to manage the occurrence of the new risk
	2. if one or more mitigation measure is warranted, redraw the system diagram to incorporate the new sets of key factors to fully capture the dynamic complexity of the original and new risk situations.
6. reassess the system model developed in task 2, identify whether other risk mitigation measures may be employed? if yes, compare the relative effectiveness of the new measures against that proposed in task 4 based on the configurations of the systems model presented in task 2.
7. assess the relationship between the new risk management measure(s) (i.e., those identified in Task 5 & 6) and that presented in task 4 (i.e., original risk management measure) based on the notion of strategic fit advanced by Porter (1996) and appraise the sustainability of all the proposed risk management measures accordingly.

## Part 1

Dear ladies and gentlemen, 

Welcome to our presentation about one of the world's leading fashion corporations, Cotton On Group. Cotton On Group is, locating in Victoria, Australia, merchandising in men's, boy's and women's clothing, recognised as the largest retailer for fashion clothing and brands in Australia. Having more than 1300 stores worldwide in 20 major countries, with stock replenished daily, the company has its distribution centre located in Avalon, Melbourne, where its warehouse manager distribute all the shipping, receiving of orders. It is acknowledged, by nearly every retailer, that the average time to restock and replenish would require 4 to 6 weeks in approximation, and the company in 2018 even started to employ and build themselves packing machines in their largest distribution centre {Cotton On Group, 2021 #195}.

However, it is the case here and now that in those Cotton On shops, the busiest ones, consumers fail frequently to find and to satisfy their needs, or to purchase for items, due to the utter reality of stock out. It is a large company, of course, so it is understandable. But Cotton On Group recognises this issue and is trying to solve it. Their logistics department is trying to find a solution that is sufficient and efficient to deal with the stock out problem, as well as is strong and sustainable enough to be generalised to be able to apply to every other retail stores in the world. And, we have determined some of the fundamental issues at heart, as listed here.

1. Storage capacity. The busiest store in Australia of the Cotton On Group would be the Flagship on the Bourke Street, in Melbourne. In that retail store, the storage place is shared with the staff rooms for rest, which is also quite small compared to the store.
2. Shortage of store staff and shop assistants at the moment and basically, any time before.
3. Work efficiency, which is also partly caused by the small storage place, since it would be hard for staff to find certain items for customers, which are at the same time in short supply and buried deep in the room.

We know, of course, that every stock out problem is partly contributing to a larger logistics problem. In essence, it is a systematic failure. To understand the scale of it, please take a few minutes to take a look at this picture that we demonstrate.

The systematic failure is to be investigated. First, we must identify that stock out situation is a potential risk that may happen in any given retail store. The impact is both wide and catastrophic. The company has its stakeholders, which are to be affected by this risk. And these stakeholders include all the retail stores' managers and employees etc. So it should be acknowledged, firstly, that stock out is a risk that is going to affect Cotton On Group stakeholders. But how, when there is a distribution centre that is in charge of all ins and outs? That is the question that needs to be answered.

Before we move on the deeper research, we need to first identify the basic framework for it. It needs to be simple, direct, and applicable. Therefore, we have returned to the basic principles, that is:

First: What is the current situation?
Second: What are the possible causes of it, the most direct?
Third: What does the current situation lead to?

Then we implemented the process by amending some other procedures.

And this brings us to the next point of research: risk analysis in terms of key influencing factors, since the situation has been illustrated. First, we are going to filter what and who are in the process at the local store. We analysed the current issue in Flagship, and found that there are three major contributing factors that are the most direct: Low inventory space, delay in shipment delivery, imprecise planning of stock, and shortage of staff (we could abbreviate it as SOS). Each of these factors are multifaceted due to the systematic complex they are in.

Then, we asked ourselves the third question. The possible outcomes would include, surely, the loss in revenue and profit, whether of the local retail store or of the parent company. This is another situation of risks, so the basic problem solving principles also apply here. We thus concluded that the direct causes of revenue and profit loss? First, stock out means there is less to sell than is expected, so it would be the depreciation of quantity in stock. Second, customers would buy less because there is nothing to buy, concluded as dropping customer purchase. Third, a business relies on its reputation to function normally, so the store image would be proportionally destroyed because of stock out which should not entirely the store's responsibility. Fourth, the customer buying less phenomenon indicate there would be less customers to the shop, i.e., customer loyalty declination.

We then did a retrospection over this study process, and found that it is an ongoing process. Where there is an incident of stock out at some retail store, there would be revenue and profit loss, which increasingly contributes to SOS, i.e., shortage of staff. SOS will in turn contribute to stock out and the cycle would recycle itself.

We then come to the next point of risk analysis: risk mitigation. Since we have based our principles, the mitigation could then be regarded as mitigating the negative causes and strengthening the positive factors. We chose both. We have identified in our research that the imprecise planning of stock, or the inventory demand forecast, would be one of the key factors that lead to stock out. The reason why we had chosen it is mainly that the Cotton On Group operate upon the international scale, thus it remains still a challenge for Cotton On Group to evaluate the required stock in every retail store. Thus we proceed to consider how to manage the influencing factors.

First, in the case of risk mitigation, it proves to be more efficient in introducing new positive factors into the business processes than narrowing and weakening the negative causes {El Baz, 2021 #87}. Introducing new concepts and approaches could improve an organisation's supply chain resilience, and thus would have positive influence on the risk mitigation, in this case to be stock out {Kochan, 2018 #88}. Here, we illustrated some few basic positive factors, and one of them is introducing technology.

When a corporation operates internationally, the data it needs to make decisions would be monumentally large. In such a world where computer is dominating every area of life, it would be folly to not adopt technology as a tool to help to speed up data processing as well as information extraction from those data. The idea of Big Data is not new today, but its potential as to application in supply chain management has not yet fully achieved. In fact, it would be much easier to document and manage all the stock distribution processes using big data to predict possible need for every retail store, since one of the main usage of big data is to predict what and how a measurement changes into in the future {Brinch, 2018 #196}.

Moreover, corporations such as Cotton On Group should also consider the application of AI. The application of AI in the market has already been diverse: analysing data, extracting information, helping in decision making, interpreting information from data and predicting future outcomes, etc. For Cotton On Group, the usage of AI could be more than imagination. AI could serve as employees to help customers' decision making and purchasing, enhancing their overall experiences in the retail store, unifying possible need for stock replenishment and reporting in time, while also cut off one major cost for the company.

Supply chain resilience, on the other hand, should try to avoid hazards. In our prior research of the situation, we have found that improper orders, shipment routing errors and delay in shipment delivery all contribute to the negative outcome: stock out. These factors are all to a certain extent unpredictable, since they might be affected by the weather, temporary road maintenance which causes routing change, air crash, etc. Thus, to mitigate them requires further efforts and investments. This, however, requires Cotton On Group to be more cautious in their operations, in that introducing big data and AI into business practices means data security would constitute the new risk, which would be more disastrous than stock out if gone wrong. To find and maintain the balance is always the key.

Thank you, all.

### Phase 1 Introduction

#### 1.1 Overview

In such a world today as it is continuously and increasingly shaped by globalisation and activities in the globalising process, the risks that corporations face and have to deal with, whether small or big in scale, are getting more and more complex, as well as more serious. And as current literature has shown, risk management in the field has not taken a holistic, and systematic perspective, with the majority of literature focus on the risk management on a part, or parts, of the corporations' value chains {Kochan, 2018 #88}. Supply chain resilience, so it is called, is vital especially to those big corporations that manage and are engage in transoceanic trades, as is the case for the corporation that will be addressed in this essay, the Cotton On Group.

The Cotton On Group, located in Victoria, Australia, is one of the world's leading fashion corporations. Merchandising in males' and females' clothing, the company is recognised globally as the largest retailer for fashion clothing and brands in Australia {EBSCO Industries Inc,  #192}. It has over 1300 stores worldwide, in 20 major countries, with its stock replenished daily. The Cotton On Group has 668 stores in Australia for now, according to one of their reports on their official website {Cotton On Group, 2021 #195}. The company has its distribution centre located in Avalon, Melbourne. The managers in that warehouse are in charge of all the shipping and receiving orders.

However, with such a huge scale of the corporation, the distribution centre alone are only not sufficient to engage all the orders. The approximately time that is needed for the distribution centre to fulfill the requests and orders from all the stores in Australia are estimated at four to six weeks {Cotton On Group, 2021 #195}. This is not a good news. According to one of the company's busiest stores in Australia, called "Flagship", the store has been and is increasingly affected by problems relating to stock supply and availability. There would often be such cases as customers walked in the store and found something he or she desires, and intended to purchase, while they only would be told that the store did not currently have that item in stock, or that the other sizes were at that time missing, or that the item had been sold out being popular, and would only receive the sincere apologies from the store manager and assistants.

But, when considering the case for that specific store, i.e., the Flagship retailer, it is not hard to reach to such a conclusion that the similar circumstances are likely to happen in any of the company's retail stores. The Cotton On Group thus is also trying to reach to a solution of this situation, and would invest in much to enhance their customers' shopping experience, since it is clear that if customer dissonance occurs more and more, the profitability of the corporation would only decrease in value, and the reputation of the company, including its retail stores, would be increasingly damaged.

Based on these findings for a deeper and more thorough research for a better way to conduct risk management, there are a few factors that will be listed here, and more factors will be introduced later in this essay. The first three direct factors contributing to stock out in Flagship could be summarised here as:

1. The comparatively weak storage capacity. The Flagship has a storage room that shares the space of the room for employees to take a rest. While it is economically efficient, it is not sufficient for the store if comparing the sizes of the two.
2. The shortage of store staff. There are currently not enough shop assistants to manage the clothing sections, and there are not enough employees who are responsible for checking out products being purchased. 
3. The low work efficiency. It is partly the result of the two previous factors, but it is also due to some other factors that will be discussed later in the article, for example, inaccurate provision for shipment, wrong estimation of future stock in need, especially when considering the lockdown of cities affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, which has caused Australia as a economy shrink in many sectors.

#### 2.2 Analysis

The diagram above is a rough demonstration of the stock out which poses a risk situation for the Cotton On Group corporation, and it also shows other factors that contribute to such a risk situation, at the corporation's retail stores, of which the Flagship is an example. First of all, some factors are the main, or primary elements that constitute such a problem, for example, the storage space of the retail store is too small compared with the size of the store. Secondly, the store staff are insufficient, too, while there might also be the problem of the store managers who are not so well trained, or trained inadequately. Third, the low work efficiency also contributes to the risk. There are more factors, but they would be listed in the table later in this article.

The situation is, however, after detailed inquiring and investigation, found to be influenced by some other aspects, such as the unmatched stock request that is being handle wrongly. That is, the expected stock replenishment is not reached, because of the data was transferred with noise, if considering this from an information theory point of view. The inaccurate planning of stock replenishment thus causes the other factors to be changing, or even deteriorating, like the work efficiency of staff at retail stores. For example, in a retail store like the Flagship, the store manager should be prepared and report to the corporation and the distribution centre that the store needs replenishment. But, in the process of counting and measuring what will be needed for the next sale season, the managers or the executive staff made an error of miscounting, the possible outcome is that the confirmation would be wrongly approved by the distribution centre, and the shipment when it is due would only not satisfy customers' needs. The problem then continues to grow, as customers coming to stores become less, to an extent to which staff efficiency would only drop which leads to less cases of customer satisfaction and more cases of customer dissonance. Customer loyalty to the store, the brand, as well as the corporation itself, will decrease. This is an ongoing cycle that repeats itself when it is initiated.

Therefore, it is needed to differentiate between the influencing factors that directly impact on the stock out risk situation, and the nurturing factors that would strengthen these influencing factors, because they work on different echelons. These nurturing factors increase the possibility of the issues by making those issues occur more frequently. These factors include staff members being unavailable for product unpacking and stacking, or for customer assistance, due to the shortage of staff; Or the shortage of space for storage, which is made up of the inadequate distribution and which potentially leads to inaccurate or imprecise shipment. All these factors, being influencing or nurturing, evidently and eventually constitute the bigger problem of stock out situation, leading to potential revenue and profit loss for the company, and to the stakeholders being in risk for which managers of the company should be held accountable.
