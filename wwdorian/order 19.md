Objectives:
1. appraisal of risk **problems**, in particular business risk situations, from a multi-dimensional perspective.
2. reinforce the notion that risk is context-specific.
3. risk management is predicated on a socially constructed reality of the world.
4. a holistic approach.
5. use the dynamic system analysis technique to model a risk situation or risk management problem in business.

### Requirements

1. describe, with the aid of a diagram, the context in which the problem being investigated is embedded.
	1. the surrounding factors, which, arguably, would have affected the way the risk problem has emerged.
	2. the interactions between these factors which could change the relational dynamics leading to the further development of the problem.
	3. indicate how you have obtained the information needed to understand the risk context.
2. use the technique of systems modelling, characterise the problem situation selected as a complex dynamic system by tracing the interdependency relationships between the key variables and nurturing conditions under which the risk would most likely occur.
	1. justify all identified causal links between the key variables and nurturing conditions surrounding the occurrence of the risk situation.
3. based on the system developed to represent the risk situation, systematically assess the level of control, uncertainty and risk potential embedded in each of the key variables and nurturing conditions perceived to give rise to the risk situation
	1. assess the degree of control, levels of residual uncertainty, and growth potential pertaining to each of the key variables and nurturing conditions perceived to be antecedents of the risk situation being considered.
4. use the results of the assessment conducted under task 3, derive one appropriate risk management measure, which may be applied to reduce the risk involved.
	1. rationalise the merits of the proposed measure by drawing on the various schools of thought discussed in the risk management doctrines provided in Hood et al.
5. if the proposed measure is likely to reduce or manage the perceived risk, assess whether the intended action is likely to create a new risk situation.
	1. if so, examine whether any new measure(s) has to be adopted to manage the occurrence of the new risk
	2. if one or more mitigation measure is warranted, redraw the system diagram to incorporate the new sets of key factors to fully capture the dynamic complexity of the original and new risk situations.
6. reassess the system model developed in task 2, identify whether other risk mitigation measures may be employed? if yes, compare the relative effectiveness of the new measures against that proposed in task 4 based on the configurations of the systems model presented in task 2.
7. assess the relationship between the new risk management measure(s) (i.e., those identified in Task 5 & 6) and that presented in task 4 (i.e., original risk management measure) based on the notion of strategic fit advanced by Porter (1996) and appraise the sustainability of all the proposed risk management measures accordingly.

## Part 1

Dear ladies and gentlemen, 

Welcome to our presentation about one of the world's leading fashion corporations, Cotton On Group. Cotton On Group is, locating in Victoria, Australia, merchandising in men's, boy's and women's clothing, recognised as the largest retailer for fashion clothing and brands in Australia. Having more than 1300 stores worldwide in 20 major countries, with stock replenished daily, the company has its distribution centre located in Avalon, Melbourne, where its warehouse manager distribute all the shipping, receiving of orders. It is acknowledged, by nearly every retailer, that the average time to restock and replenish would require 4 to 6 weeks in approximation, and the company in 2018 even started to employ and build themselves packing machines in their largest distribution centre {Cotton On Group, 2021 #195}.

However, it is the case here and now that in those Cotton On shops, the busiest ones, consumers fail frequently to find and to satisfy their needs, or to purchase for items, due to the utter reality of stock out. It is a large company, of course, so it is understandable. But Cotton On Group recognises this issue and is trying to solve it. Their logistics department is trying to find a solution that is sufficient and efficient to deal with the stock out problem, as well as is strong and sustainable enough to be generalised to be able to apply to every other retail stores in the world. And, we have determined some of the fundamental issues at heart, as listed here.

1. Storage capacity. The busiest store in Australia of the Cotton On Group would be the Flagship on the Bourke Street, in Melbourne. In that retail store, the storage place is shared with the staff rooms for rest, which is also quite small compared to the store.
2. Shortage of store staff and shop assistants at the moment and basically, any time before.
3. Work efficiency, which is also partly caused by the small storage place, since it would be hard for staff to find certain items for customers, which are at the same time in short supply and buried deep in the room.

We know, of course, that every stock out problem is partly contributing to a larger logistics problem. In essence, it is a systematic failure. To understand the scale of it, please take a few minutes to take a look at this picture that we demonstrate.

The systematic failure is to be investigated. First, we must identify that stock out situation is a potential risk that may happen in any given retail store. The impact is both wide and catastrophic. The company has its stakeholders, which are to be affected by this risk. And these stakeholders include all the retail stores' managers and employees etc. So it should be acknowledged, firstly, that stock out is a risk that is going to affect Cotton On Group stakeholders. But how, when there is a distribution centre that is in charge of all ins and outs? That is the question that needs to be answered.

Before we move on the deeper research, we need to first identify the basic framework for it. It needs to be simple, direct, and applicable. Therefore, we have returned to the basic principles, that is:

First: What is the current situation?
Second: What are the possible causes of it, the most direct?
Third: What does the current situation lead to?

Then we implemented the process by amending some other procedures.

And this brings us to the next point of research: risk analysis in terms of key influencing factors, since the situation has been illustrated. First, we are going to filter what and who are in the process at the local store. We analysed the current issue in Flagship, and found that there are three major contributing factors that are the most direct: Low inventory space, delay in shipment delivery, imprecise planning of stock, and shortage of staff (we could abbreviate it as SOS). Each of these factors are multifaceted due to the systematic complex they are in.

Then, we asked ourselves the third question. The possible outcomes would include, surely, the loss in revenue and profit, whether of the local retail store or of the parent company. This is another situation of risks, so the basic problem solving principles also apply here. We thus concluded that the direct causes of revenue and profit loss? First, stock out means there is less to sell than is expected, so it would be the depreciation of quantity in stock. Second, customers would buy less because there is nothing to buy, concluded as dropping customer purchase. Third, a business relies on its reputation to function normally, so the store image would be proportionally destroyed because of stock out which should not entirely the store's responsibility. Fourth, the customer buying less phenomenon indicate there would be less customers to the shop, i.e., customer loyalty declination.

We then did a retrospection over this study process, and found that it is an ongoing process. Where there is an incident of stock out at some retail store, there would be revenue and profit loss, which increasingly contributes to SOS, i.e., shortage of staff. SOS will in turn contribute to stock out and the cycle would recycle itself.

We then come to the next point of risk analysis: risk mitigation. Since we have based our principles, the mitigation could then be regarded as mitigating the negative causes and strengthening the positive factors. We chose both. We have identified in our research that the imprecise planning of stock, or the inventory demand forecast, would be one of the key factors that lead to stock out. The reason why we had chosen it is mainly that the Cotton On Group operate upon the international scale, thus it remains still a challenge for Cotton On Group to evaluate the required stock in every retail store. Thus we proceed to consider how to manage the influencing factors.

First, in the case of risk mitigation, it proves to be more efficient in introducing new positive factors into the business processes than narrowing and weakening the negative causes {El Baz, 2021 #87}. Introducing new concepts and approaches could improve an organisation's supply chain resilience, and thus would have positive influence on the risk mitigation, in this case to be stock out {Kochan, 2018 #88}. Here, we illustrated some few basic positive factors, and one of them is introducing technology.

When a corporation operates internationally, the data it needs to make decisions would be monumentally large. In such a world where computer is dominating every area of life, it would be folly to not adopt technology as a tool to help to speed up data processing as well as information extraction from those data. The idea of Big Data is not new today, but its potential as to application in supply chain management has not yet fully achieved. In fact, it would be much easier to document and manage all the stock distribution processes using big data to predict possible need for every retail store, since one of the main usage of big data is to predict what and how a measurement changes into in the future {Brinch, 2018 #196}.

Moreover, corporations such as Cotton On Group should also consider the application of AI. The application of AI in the market has already been diverse: analysing data, extracting information, helping in decision making, interpreting information from data and predicting future outcomes, etc. For Cotton On Group, the usage of AI could be more than imagination. AI could serve as employees to help customers' decision making and purchasing, enhancing their overall experiences in the retail store, unifying possible need for stock replenishment and reporting in time, while also cut off one major cost for the company.

Supply chain resilience, on the other hand, should try to avoid hazards. In our prior research of the situation, we have found that improper orders, shipment routing errors and delay in shipment delivery all contribute to the negative outcome: stock out. These factors are all to a certain extent unpredictable, since they might be affected by the weather, temporary road maintenance which causes routing change, air crash, etc. Thus, to mitigate them requires further efforts and investments. This, however, requires Cotton On Group to be more cautious in their operations, in that introducing big data and AI into business practices means data security would constitute the new risk, which would be more disastrous than stock out if gone wrong. To find and maintain the balance is always the key.

Thank you, all.


## Part 2

### Phase 1 Introduction

#### 1.1 Overview

In such a world today as it is continuously and increasingly shaped by globalisation and activities in the globalising process, the risks that corporations face and have to deal with, whether small or big in scale, are getting more and more complex, as well as more serious. And as current literature has shown, risk management in the field has not taken a holistic, and systematic perspective, with the majority of literature focus on the risk management on a part, or parts, of the corporations' value chains {Kochan, 2018 #88}. Supply chain resilience, so it is called, is vital especially to those big corporations that manage and are engage in transoceanic trades, as is the case for the corporation that will be addressed in this essay, the Cotton On Group.

The Cotton On Group, located in Victoria, Australia, is one of the world's leading fashion corporations. Merchandising in males' and females' clothing, the company is recognised globally as the largest retailer for fashion clothing and brands in Australia {EBSCO Industries Inc,  #192}. It has over 1300 stores worldwide, in 20 major countries, with its stock replenished daily. The Cotton On Group has 668 stores in Australia for now, according to one of their reports on their official website {Cotton On Group, 2021 #195}. The company has its distribution centre located in Avalon, Melbourne. The managers in that warehouse are in charge of all the shipping and receiving orders.

However, with such a huge scale of the corporation, the distribution centre alone are only not sufficient to engage all the orders. The approximately time that is needed for the distribution centre to fulfill the requests and orders from all the stores in Australia are estimated at four to six weeks {Cotton On Group, 2021 #195}. This is not a good news. According to one of the company's busiest stores in Australia, called "Flagship", the store has been and is increasingly affected by problems relating to stock supply and availability. There would often be such cases as customers walked in the store and found something he or she desires, and intended to purchase, while they only would be told that the store did not currently have that item in stock, or that the other sizes were at that time missing, or that the item had been sold out being popular, and would only receive the sincere apologies from the store manager and assistants.

But, when considering the case for that specific store, i.e., the Flagship retailer, it is not hard to reach to such a conclusion that the similar circumstances are likely to happen in any of the company's retail stores. The Cotton On Group thus is also trying to reach to a solution of this situation, and would invest in much to enhance their customers' shopping experience, since it is clear that if customer dissonance occurs more and more, the profitability of the corporation would only decrease in value, and the reputation of the company, including its retail stores, would be increasingly damaged.

Based on these findings for a deeper and more thorough research for a better way to conduct risk management, there are a few factors that will be listed here, and more factors will be introduced later in this essay. The first three direct factors contributing to stock out in Flagship could be summarised here as:

1. The comparatively weak storage capacity. The Flagship has a storage room that shares the space of the room for employees to take a rest. While it is economically efficient, it is not sufficient for the store if comparing the sizes of the two.
2. The shortage of store staff. There are currently not enough shop assistants to manage the clothing sections, and there are not enough employees who are responsible for checking out products being purchased. 
3. The low work efficiency. It is partly the result of the two previous factors, but it is also due to some other factors that will be discussed later in the article, for example, inaccurate provision for shipment, wrong estimation of future stock in need, especially when considering the lockdown of cities affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, which has caused Australia as a economy shrink in many sectors.

#### 1.2 Picturing the Problem

### Phase 2 Retrospection

#### 2.1 Diagram Modelling

#### 2.2 Analysis

The diagram above is a rough demonstration of the stock out which poses a risk situation for the Cotton On Group corporation, and it also shows other factors that contribute to such a risk situation, at the corporation's retail stores, of which the Flagship is an example. First of all, some factors are the main, or primary elements that constitute such a problem, for example, the storage space of the retail store is too small compared with the size of the store. Secondly, the store staff are insufficient, too, while there might also be the problem of the store managers who are not so well trained, or trained inadequately. Third, the low work efficiency also contributes to the risk. There are more factors, but they would be listed in the table later in this article.

The situation is, however, after detailed inquiring and investigation, found to be influenced by some other aspects, such as the unmatched stock request that is being handle wrongly. That is, the expected stock replenishment is not reached, because of the data was transferred with noise, if considering this from an information theory point of view. The inaccurate planning of stock replenishment thus causes the other factors to be changing, or even deteriorating, like the work efficiency of staff at retail stores. For example, in a retail store like the Flagship, the store manager should be prepared and report to the corporation and the distribution centre that the store needs replenishment. But, in the process of counting and measuring what will be needed for the next sale season, the managers or the executive staff made an error of miscounting, the possible outcome is that the confirmation would be wrongly approved by the distribution centre, and the shipment when it is due would only not satisfy customers' needs. The problem then continues to grow, as customers coming to stores become less, to an extent to which staff efficiency would only drop which leads to less cases of customer satisfaction and more cases of customer dissonance. Customer loyalty to the store, the brand, as well as the corporation itself, will decrease. This is an ongoing cycle that repeats itself when it is initiated.

Therefore, it is needed to differentiate between the influencing factors that directly impact on the stock out risk situation, and the nurturing factors that would strengthen these influencing factors, because they work on different echelons. These nurturing factors increase the possibility of the issues by making those issues occur more frequently. These factors include staff members being unavailable for product unpacking and stacking, or for customer assistance, due to the shortage of staff; Or the shortage of space for storage, which is made up of the inadequate distribution and which potentially leads to inaccurate or imprecise shipment. All these factors, being influencing or nurturing, evidently and eventually constitute the bigger problem of stock out situation, leading to potential revenue and profit loss for the company, and to the stakeholders being in risk for which managers of the company should be held accountable.

### Phase 3 Analysis of Key Influencing Factors and Nurturing Factors

---

### Phase 4 Risk Mitigation

#### 4.1 Risk Mitigation Measurement

Therefore, with the support from the given diagrams and tables outlined and presented above, there are some fundamental risk influencing factors, including these key variables and nurturing factors. First, there is the key variable, imprecise replenishment plan, which is one of the key factors that cause the stock out risk situation. The degree of autonomy of it is the lowest in the systematic dynamics when comparing to other variables. However, the level of growth dynamic of it is comparatively and relatively high. So it would be sensible to consider it as the foremost factor into consideration when the corporation is trying to mitigate the risk outcomes. Thus, the risk mitigation measurement should regard this factor with the highest importance and the most attention.

In considering how to mitigate this key variable in the risk system, it is suggested by many researchers, such as Brinch, that the use of Big Data in the supply chain management would increase the corporation's efficiency and staffs' efficacy {Brinch, 2018 #657}. The Big Data has been overwhelmingly shaping the business world and how people, that is, customers, look at the world and in shaping their perspectives of the information in the fashion industry, particularly the fashion retail industry. There has been growing trends in using Big Data to increase the efficiency of the product promotion campaigns, and the volatility of it has never been seen before the birth of Big Data. The adoption of the Big Data technology has shaped the efficiency of the planning and prediction processes of the stock that would be needed in the next sales season in the fashion market, the reason of which lies in the insurmountable mass of the data that are collected and available on platforms, particularly those social media, and their existence as well as availability to customers have increasingly shaped their stance of products, their tastes, their preferences, and such {Ren, 2020 #769}.

Also, the recent boiling and trendy topic of Artificial Intelligence (AI), debated by renowned scientists Stephen Hawking and world-famous entrepreneurs such as Elon Mask, has been also introduced into nearly all areas of business operations in the market, globally. Many businesses use AI to improve their efficiency in ordering, confirming and syncing across their online platforms. Moreover, for some specific industries, such as the fashion industry and other industries that are inherently required to be responsible and acting fast in juxtaposition with the trends in the market at that time, AI has helped them to enhance their performance, by applying smart algorithms and by enabling computers to be able do collect, analyse and more importantly, interpret data into human friendly information for future development and update of business strategies, whether it is in trading, incorporating, in merger, or in advertising and etc.{Li, 2019 #590}.

With these being said, the Cotton On Group could adopt the technologies of Big Data and AI combined to create and to improve their current sales performance, by incorporating the mentioned technologies into their fundamental business operations and activate the real potential in the corporation's value chain with higher growth rate. Especially, when the key variable is within the field of logistics, it becomes more important to improving the current situation or to solve the current risk situation so as to save its flagship store and the corporation's other stores.

It is suggested that the Cotton On Group finds some companies that provide both the services of Big Data and AI, and that are capable of transforming these two services into one software for the management of the entire value chain so as to implement the current business strategies, securing it, and enhancing it. Therefore, it is suggested that the Cotton On Group should inquire and consult the company Excelion. With its services provided as they could be tailor-made, the company could provide the Cotton On Group with better performance in terms of the stock planning, predicting of the demand for the next sales sseason, billing, current stocking statistics and analyses, customer records both for the past and for the present, and etc. The demand forecast algorithm that is provided by the Excelion could harness information from the past records and statistics fo Cotton On Group staff to not worry about keeping data anymore; it could be automatically done within seconds. There are also some other techniques for collecting data that are directly or indirectly relevant to sales, for example, the weather forecast, which influences that store's number of walk-in customers; the social media techniques, for instance, SOE, short for "search engine optimisation" which would increase the company and its brands' possibility of being aware by customers and potential ones. 

In addition to this, there would be some requirements for adopting such a system and for incorporating it into core business operations. Such a program, in order to find out and to predict trends and future growth, would require data that are stored in the past. That is, sales statistics, data analysis based on past sales modelling, risk situation factors listed out, and so on. There would be the need to implement these data, which means that the accuracy should be reminded as a constant practice. This further requirement an update in the protocols both in the Head Office of the corporation, and at the retail stores. When such a practice is implemented, there could be assurance that the data would be in sync and thus the plan and predict of stock in demand from the stores would not be a key risk problem for the company.

Certain advantages would be as follows:

1. Improved accuracy of the demand from the store process. The system has become adaptable to the situation at any time and it would be constantly updating and upgrading itself, which means the data would be in sync from the store manager and the Distribution Centre. That is because of the data modelling made by incorporating Big Data and AI would be highly efficient in terms of handling an explosive amount of data. And with the results made from the data analysis by the AI, the Head Office managers would be able to decide with greater certainty what should be adopted in the future.

2. The dependency on the past sales data would be less required. The company used to take account of the past sales data, and analyse them to predict the future. However, if considering that everything on the Internet would change its form, let alone their content, it is possible that the corporation's previous method of modelling and interpretation of the data would be not in sync with the market environment, and thus there would be risks of falling behind in the current highly competitive environment of the market.

#### 4.2 Doctrines Used to Rationalise the Merits of Solutions

##### Qualitativism

Qualitavism is employed by this research of a risk situation scenario, which stress on the authenticity, accuracy, and objectivity, which means the methods enforces the research to be value laden {Moulton, 2014 #535}. There would be numerous, or even innumerable factors that contribute to a specific risk situation. It is because a single risk situation is impossible to be a stand alone effect or result. This thus requires a researcher to be selective. That being said, it goes back to the "value laden" point which is a prerequisite. Thus, because of these considerations, this research employs the doctrine of qualitativism to ensure objectivity. There would be other tangible or intangible factors, of course, and they would be taken into considerations due to the purpose of effectiveness since this is also a risk mitigation project. However, the priority is given to the closest related factors for the purpose of viability. And, therefore, Cotton On Group took up the solution which is to use AI to enhance its performance in terms of logistics and factors related.

##### Absolutism

Absolutism was adopted to analyse what are the causes of the issue at hand which caused the eventual risk situation. But, when considering a risk situation, human beings would easily fall into the fallacy based upon blamism, which increases the risk of putting the responsibility to external factors, while the reality is the risks are inherent since they are caused by internal factors. Thus, absolutism is adopted. The company would have to realise that the risk situation was caused by the company's internal processes and thus it should take full responsibilities regardless of their might-intended inclination or preference of blamism.

And, with this consideration, the introduction of AI and Big Data, in the form of software by Excelion, would be a practical solution, since this is a system that is based on computers which can be influenced by human interference to the least degree. However, if the risk continues to exist, it would be possible for managers to track down who are those people and make its decisions as to how to better its management.

##### Trade-offism

There would be trade off, in everything in the world, and in every interactions between two elements in a system. The company, Cotton On Group, is an international corporation, a conglomerate, whose main aim is to increase its revenues and profitability. It is argued, however, that there need to be trade offs in the operations of the corporation, since the company needs to ensure its operations would be able to mitigate risk situations as much as possible, rather than to ignore them. Moreover, the company has been through an amount of risk situations of stock out, then it would be sensible to consider what effects these stock outs would have on the revenue making process and the company's profitability. So, with adopting trade-offism, the company invests money on introducing technologies to strengthen its capabilities to manage and, to be able to mitigate, or even avoid such risk situations.

### Phase 5

#### 5.1 New Risk Situations

The software by Excelion would increase the managers of the company and of the store with better abilities to take control of their sales and other aspects of risks, enhancing the company's performance in terms of finance, investment, logistics, and etc. The system would increase the resilience of the company's value chain, by enabling the workers, employees, managers, and staffs to be able to satisfy customers' needs and improve their degree of satisfaction. There would be, however, new risk situations, since risks would always be present or potential while new components are introduced into a system.

The Cotton On Group intends to implement the system based on the software to all the retailers, and it would cause another form of risks, which are mainly risks related to the resilience of the computer system and such. So it would be also required to consider what may happen when such risks happen, and it is sensible to do so, since risks are a constant subject in management, always {Aven, 2016 #630}.

##### Information Security

After implementing the system and installing the software, everything would be stored as data. With the increasingly improving abilities of systems and along with it, hackers, the information security would at stake if the data are not properly stored and secured. Furthermore, if the data are leaked, which is itself an issue and a risk, there might be public concerns as to why the company would store their information in the system while shopping. Similar cases have happened to Apple, Amazon, Google, and other world famous technology companies, let alone the Cotton On Group which operates in the fashion industry.

##### System Crash

System crash is possible, since computers rely on stable electricity. However, the company is not itself in control of the power, so when there is some power off scenarios, whether they are caused by irregular weather, or poor electricity management by the electricity providers such as the government, the company would face a hugely possible risk of revenue and profits loss. Other factors would also affect this situation, such as lack of technical knowledge to manage the system by some staff that causes a domino effect in the system, such as the loss of data which could even be regarded as a minor risk {Garg, 2013 #770}.

Moreover, if there are technical problems that exist due to wrong or inefficient codes by programmers, which would cause the results that the program provide to be incorrect or inaccurate, leading to further risk of losses in revenue and profit. A program needs to be updated to employ the state-of-the-art technologies and algorithms to keep up with the society's growing needs, and that would involve the risk of introducing new program bugs. And, possibilities are that the bugs would also allow hackers to steal information from the computers and from the corporation, which would be highly destructive if the data are sold by the hackers to other companies who are competitors of Cotton On Group in a given area in the market.

#### 5.2 New Risk Mitigation Measures

There are some techniques that the company could utilise to ensure the security of data, and/or at least mitigate the risks and their results.

1. Proper training to ensure there is the least data loss. Many problems are not caused by the computers. They are caused by people. That is, people wrongly managed the software and corrupted the data. Thus, proper training would be much needed to ensure there would at least low possibilities that the risk is caused by employees or staffs.
2. Maintenance of the software and the system. The system is robust but also intricate. Intricacy indicates fragility. Proper and constant maintenance would be needed and should be done constantly, thus there would be less possibility that the system would break down.
3. System backup. Backups ensure that there would be another copy of the system in case the system breaks down. This enlarges the time duration during which the company handles the risk situation, to salvage data and possible potential revenue and profit loss.
4. Training staff and set up policy to ensure data security. The staff should be trained to understand the importance of data security, and should acquired sufficient knowledge as to how they can contribute to the security of data.
5. Finally, the management from the Head Office. All operations would be required to be approved by the Head Office. Therefore, the managerial echelon in the Head Office should be actively engaged in the processes that were mentioned above.

The Cotton On Group should also consider hiring programmers and set up an IT department to ensure there would be constant monitor of the system and required maintenance. Or, if this is not a viable option, the company should consider hiring third party companies who are experts in this field to maintain and secure the system, which would not be costly for the company but the result of trade off would be a bargain for the management of the company {Kaplan, 2012 #771}.

### Phase 6

#### 6.1 Solution for the New Risk

Alternative risk measures could be used to give more space to store the stock, which is the one of the key variables in the risk situation system, and is also one of the major factor. The solution could help the Cotton On Group to overcome the current issue of stock out to the extent to which the issue would be resolved and are listed here.

##### Solution for Lack of Storage Space 

The solution that are proposed here for the lack of storage space is to redesign the store thus to allow more storage area, thereby to increase the stock inventory and to increase the efficiency in managing the stock. At present the issue is the store needs more area for storage of the stock. It could be concluded that the stock is not organised stacked, and is thus unable to meet customers' expectation which eventually causes customer dissatisfaction, and at last, the losses in revenue and profit. Therefore, effective demand management strategies should be used to avoid the stock out risk situation at every store. But, it would be of great befefit to the Cotton On Group to monitor the current risk situation, assess it, evaluate it and understand the mechanisms behind it by regarding it as a system, to not only get a glimpse of the situation, but to have an overview of where needs implementation and upgrading {Smallman, 1996 #773}. If then after the storage problem has been resolved, the store manager would be able to manage the store by using better strategies provided by his or her supervisors from the Head Office. Increased storage space can also help the store manager to plan ahead for a large quantity of stock while before he or she would only be able to ask for approval every time for a minor amount of stock.

#### 6.2 Reflection on Two Risk Measurements

In considering the two measurements above, it could be argued and concluded that implementing Big Data and AI would be of higher priority than to redesign the store space layout. If the Cotton On Group eventually goes for the second measurement, which is to redesign the store, the sales performance of this particular store would inevitably increase. But, this particular retail store alone. And, the stock out risk situation may happen at other stores. The implementation of technology and computer software, on the other hand, could benefit every store, and it would be easy to install on computers if there is going to be a new store to be built, which would eliminate the risk situation from its root.

It could be understood that to implement technology and incorporate it into every scale of business operations would cost much more than to redesign a store, but it could be also argued from a point of view that stresses on future payoffs and long term interest generating, that the return of investment (ROI) of utilising technology would be also much higher than to simply redesign a store. Furthermore, the statistics generated by computer can by analysed by computer, and can assist managers of the corporation to better manage and increase, finally, the revenue and profits of the corporation.

### Phase 7 Sustainable Risk Management

It should be stressed that the ultimate goal of all these risk management measurements are to increase the degree of customer satisfaction, thus to enhance the company's financial performance in terms of revenues and profits. However, from the diagrams that were presented in previous sections, it could be understood that new risk measurements would cause or imply new risk situations. Thus, backing up the system, regular maintenance, training of employees and staffs, policies being made and so on would also need to be carried out to implement the risk measurement and to manage it with higher degree of positive autonomy. The newly implemented system would be able to increase the entire system with which the company resides its value chain and in which the company operates, therefore, it would enable the company with more robustness in utilising data to not only mitigate stock out and other risk situations, but also to increase the company's strengths by applying data analyses models incorporated in Big Data and AI algorithms, all processes of which are automatic.

Furthermore, if the potential risk of data security, which implies data leaking, is able to be resolved, then there would be a higher chance of securing privacy of data of the company's customers, not only the risk of drop in social reputation would be mitigated, but also would enhance the company's social image since it could be considered a form and an act of practicing Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR), in accordance with the common traits of the contested definitions of CSR {Sheehy, 2015 #115}.

In conclusion, this model of risk management strategies for the Cotton On Group is not to the fullest extent sustainable. There are certainly some factors whose sustainability is not defined and can not be controlled by the Cotton On Group but are rather in the hands of stakeholders, for example, but these factors would never be in total control of the company, so the company could simply take control of what their stakes. The growth in revenue and profits would be guaranteed if the Cotton On Group could implement the two risk management measurements above, as has been discussed and explored.
