The problem is obvious. In reality, great books did not just only disappear from Western people's reading and lives, but also in the Easterners'. Those values are now seen as boring, ancient, outdated. They are not. The values and teachings are of vital importance - they keep surviving even after myriads of generations. But will they still, in the near future? I do have much doubt. The quiet historians keep their mouths shut; It's up to us.

> We believe that in the passage of time the neglect of these books in the twentieth century will be regarded as an aberration, and not, as it is sometimes called today, a sign of progress. We think that progress, and progress in education in particular, depends on the incorporation of the ideas and images included in this set in the daily lives of all of us, from childhood through old age. In this view the disappearance of great books from education and from the reading of adults constitutes a calamity. In this view education in the West has been steadily deteriorating; the rising generation has been deprived of its birthright; [[the mess of pottage]] it has received in exchange has not been nutritious; adults have come to lead lives comparatively rich in material comforts and very poor in moral, intellectual, and spiritual tone.
