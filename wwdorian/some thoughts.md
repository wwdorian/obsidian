So there are a few I've learnt from the short seminar today:

1. It's vital to be organised.
	- The point is not to create a beautiful mind map or something, but to both creatively and clearly understand what we're working on and how to get better at it.
	- Information should be organised because what we retrieve is raw data, which won't m and make them our own.
	- Files should be organised in that scattered files here and there would be a mess once they pile up. It would be unbearable to be overwhelmed by mountains of files without a clear structure to know what goes where.
2. The idea of management is not only for our writing.
3. The key is to automate those repetitive steps that we do every time, every day.
	- Qualitatively increasing efficiency comes from steps simplified Quantitatively.
