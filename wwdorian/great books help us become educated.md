A man should be familiar with the masterpieces, especially books, of his tradition if he wants to be (called) "educated".
It is most certainly a 'standard'. But by who was it made? History? I'm not saying it's nonsense, I do agree in fact. But still, who made this standard? Or should it not be viewed as one, instead, however, as a perspective?
