### Summary 1

Castellanos, S. (2020, August 27). Visa Unveils AI to Backstop Banks in Purchase Approvals. _The Wall Street Journal_. Retrieved from https://www.wsj.com/articles/visa-unveils-more-powerful-ai-tool-that-approves-or-denies-card-transactions-11598436001#:~:text=Sara%20Castellanos,-Biography&text=Visa%20Inc.%20said%20Wednesday%20it,is%20made%20by%20the%20bank.

This article discussed the new service, "Smarter" Stand-in-Processing (STIP), an upgraded artificial intelligence (AI), recently employed by Visa Inc., in case the bank's own systems are down, will in place of the bank approves or declines credit and debit transactions {Castellanos, 2020 #122}.

Nowadays, Visa, and many other financial institutions, are getting increasingly involved in technology, especially AI. AI is a booming area in technology, but discussions and references of it could be dated back as far as 1956 {Boobier, 2020 #139}. The current issue this STIP is designed, developed, and will be distributed is that banks, as well as merchants would lose revenues if sales are, in this case to be transactions, not completed. However, it requires analytics to determine whether a transaction should be approved. The bank system would normally be able to carry out this task, but when it comes to power cut, the bank system would fail and the potential loss in such situations would be catastrophic. Thus, even if for the quality of consumer experience, it is still inevitable to invite AI into the banking domain {Jakšič, 2019 #140}.

The main issue the author discussed in this article is related to network power off, or network disruptions that may happen temporarily but would cause significant loss both financially and in banks' reputation. Network disruptions are a hazard to banking, and it is argued in this article that it could use technology to disrupt the industry to balance out that risk, evidenced by the fact that the new STIP system even outperforms previous analysts {Castellanos, 2020 #122}. In a world where everything is being increasing digitised, what will always remain is finance. Finance powers the world, and it requires efficiency, punctuality, correctness, and responsiveness, and AI would fit in that picture.

However, what are further required should be regulations, though the article holds a positive tone {Truby, 2020 #143}. The current AI system employs a technology called "deep learning", one that imitates human brain neurons. Such a technology has already been tested and used on digital assistants such as Apple's Siri. With enough data, deep learning would be able to construct a model based on which it could predict cardholders' reliability and be able to detect inappropriate behaviours that suggest if transactions should be approved {Rönnqvist, 2017 #142}. But whether or not such approvals gain legitimacy is not yet decided, or even regulated. Further assessments are undoubtedly required, and though banks could start to install and apply this system, public concerns should be considered as banks serve their own interests only when they serve the public's.

Furthermore, although Visa described their intentions were "consumer experience", there seemed no implication that consumers are in the entire process of determining transactions' legitimacy. The current picture described in the article mainly mentioned future usage and that the system is a back up plan, but there were not any evidence that consumer experience would increase in quality, as was suggested by Mr. Taneja in the article. The second issue is thus that technology should serve human, instead of the other way around {Ahram, 2020 #145}. By making computers and machines smarter would be a glorious achievement, certainly, but if there was not any actual evidence that humans were considered, the progress in technology should be questioned.


### Summary 2

Ramkumar, A. (2021, March 8). Crowd-Safety Firm To Go Public in Merger With SPAC. *The Wall Street Journal*, p. B3. 

The author of this article mainly discusses the merger case of Evolv Technology with a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) called NewHold Investment Corp. Founded in 2013 outside of Boston, Evolv Technology is a company that aims to screen out potential risks with the assistance from artificial intelligence (AI) and data science {Ramkumar, 2021 #123}. This company has also contributed to mitigate the adverse effects brought by the COVID-19 pandemic by checking people's body temperatures. Several investors have stayed positive about the company, such as Bill Gates.

This can be regarded as a great leap of technology. Understanding is the key to success, and this company well comprehends the difficulties in management, especially under the awful situation of the new coronavirus. The introduction of AI to business processes is no longer a novel idea, but the outcomes it creates could be phenomenal {PwC, 2020 #121}. AI has been employed by than banking industry to boost companies' overall performance, and other industries must follow whether they like it or not {Boobier, 2020 #139}. From that perspective, this article has given a fair answer: the combination of AI and data science would be quite an attractive prospect.

It is said in the article, however, that Evolv is going to continue screening people, and have screened for the last 4 years over 50 million people, insisting that the purpose is solely to keep venues safe and get rid of using other security checking instruments. This should raise some concern. First, the legitimacy is not guaranteed. People should have the right to know whether they are being scanned and screened, and they should also have the right to choose whether data could be collected from them. The purpose for safety should surely be complimented, but future use such as surveillance would simply wipe out justice and the legitimacy of this technology {Padilla-López, 2015 #148}. Privacy protection weighs as heavily as security maintenance.

Nevertheless, it is of value to be able to know whether or not a person is infected by the COVID-19 virus, especially with no direct contact. Technology should be in the place of usual check techniques, of course. However, With no regard to human rights, it still remains a problem to imperatively implement such a service by this company with ethical appropriateness, as well as approval from people {Shachar, 2020 #147}.

Secondly, at the end of the article, the author mentions the popularity having been gained by the act of company combining with SPAC. This is no doubt a clever way for a crowd-safety company to get into the market and go public, and it is proven by reality that SPACs are trendy on the market even in this year {Singhi, 2020 #149}. An SPAC is a shell company, who with the other company, in this case to be Evolv Technology, through a merger and a process called "private investment in public equity" (PIPE), helps Evolv Technology to get in its place in the stock market. It seems that the process is legal, but it remains unknown yet whether there are possible accounting issues in terms of the merger. As long as it is a merger case, it should be regulated, to the extent to which the merger, the companies, and the process are proven to be legal and legitimate {Feldman, 2018 #150}.
