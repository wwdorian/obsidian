### Truth

#### Truth is the first principle of personal development.

1.  Genuine personal growth is honest growth.
2.  My first commitment must be to discover and accept new truths, no matter how difficult or unpleasant the consequences may be.
3.  I can't solve problems if I don't admit they exist.
4.  Reality is the ultimate arbiter of truth.
5.  If my thoughts, beliefs, and actions aren't aligned with truth, my results will suffer.
6.  Positioning myself in this way isn't enough to guarantee success, but siding with falsehood is enough to guarantee failure.

#### Key components

##### Perception.

The most basic aspect. If I want to improve some part of my life, I have to look at it first.

-   When I  get clear about what I don't want, I gain clarity about what I do want.
-   The first step on my path of personal growth must be to recognise that my life as it stands right now isn't how I want it to be.
-   I can't get from point A to point B if I stubbornly refuse to acknowledge that I'm at point A. Denying A, fighting A, or otherwise resisting A only keeps me stuck at A.

##### Prediction

Prediction is the mechanism by which I learn from experience, thereby enabling me to discover what is true.

As I observe any new situation or event, one of two things can happen.

-   The experience will meet my expectations.
    -   My mental model of reality remains intact.
-   The experience won't meet my expectations.
    -   My mind must update its model of reality to fit the new information

Two powerful ways I can apply my mind's predictive powers to accelerate my personal growth. And what I learn in one area can often be applied to others.

-   Embrace new experiences that are unlike anything I've previously encountered.
    -   Read a book on a topic that's completely alien to me.
    -   Talk to people I'd normally avoid.
    -   Visit an unfamiliar city.
    -   Establish basic routines only to provide a stable foundation for branching out into unexplored territory.
-   Make conscious, deliberate predictions and use those predictions to make better decisions.
    -   Think about where I'm headed and ask myself: **How do I honestly expect my life to turn out?**
    -   Imagine a very logical, impartial observer examines my situation in detail and is assigned to predict what my life will look like in 20 years, based on my current behaviour patterns. What kind of future will this person predict for me?
    -   My emotions are part of my mind's predictive output.
        -   Positive feelings stem from positive predictions.
        -   Negative feelings result from negative predictions, which serve as a warning that I must change my behaviour **now** in order to prevent unwanted predictions from coming to pass.

##### Accuracy

The closer my internal model of reality matches actual reality, the more capable I become. Greater accuracy means greater fitness for life as a human being.

-   Total clarity is a rarity. The worst part is that even when I do feel certain, that's still no guarantee I'm correct. History says it's a safe bet that there's something you think you know right now that will later prove to be false.
-   So 2 options:
    1.  Deny the unpredictability of life and create my own false sense of security
    2.  Accept the vagaries of life and learn to live with them.

The Second must always be the winner.

I needn't be paralysed by the unpredictability of life. The key is to intelligently manage risks instead of denying their existence.

Learn to thrive on uncertainty, and even enjoy it.

Some inaccuracies will self-correct as I gain additional experience and deepen my understanding of reality, but many times those errors can worsen and become self-reinforcing.

1.  Overgeneralisation: old patterns persist as long as they remain unchallenged.
2.  Prejudice: making Snap judgments without the benefit of direct experience often leads to erroneous conclusions.
3.  Self-fulfilling prophecy: subconsciously sabotage yourself by making avoidable mistakes.

The three problematic patterns all share a common element: Their predictions are overly pessimistic. On the other hand, being too optimistic is just as problematic and can lead to overconfidence, unreasonable risk taking, and manic behaviour.

The best predictions are the most accurate one, but where self-reinforcement is concerned, it's better to strengthen high self-esteem, positive emotions, and a reasonable degree of initiative, as opposed to low self-esteem, negative emotions, and undue timidity. These predictions aren't just passive observations - they're active causes unto themselves.

##### Acceptance

Once I've identified what's true for me with a reasonable degree of accuracy, my next task is to fully and completely accept the truth. This includes accepting the long-term consequences of my predictions.

One of the most important skills to develop in the area of personal growth is the ability to admit the whole truth to myself, even if I don't like what I see and even if I feel powerless to change it.

When I face unpleasant truths, I'll often encounter storng internal resistance, which pushes me to avoid facing the truth, running through endless cycles of distraction, escapism, denial, and procrastination.

Only by staring directly into these truths can I summon the strength to deal with them consciously.

A simple rule of thumb: whatever you fear, you must eventually face.

Say to myself: _This situation is wrong for me, yet I lack the strength to change it right now_.

Openly admit to myself that even though I;m stuck with complete responsibility for every area of your life, I may not have the ability to fix what isn't working at this point. Simply accept that this is how things are for now, but don't deny the truth of the situation.

If I want my situation to improve, I must first come clean with myself and admit the whole truth.

When I fully accept reality, I'll begin making better decisions because they'll be based on truth instead of fiction.

Once I fully surrender to what is, I can finally begin to create what I want.

##### Self-awareness

When I make decisions from a certain state of mind and act upon them, I reinforce that same state, thereby increasing the likelihood I'll respond similarly in the future.

Any given level of awareness has a tendency to perpetuate itself, so I'll likely find myself cycling through the same ones repeatedly.

A good way to build my awareness is to make my important decisions from the most reasonable thinking I can muster. The best point to make new choices is when I feel alert, clearheaded, and intelligent. That's the time to consider making big transformations in my life. Put the decisions in writing and fully commit myself to them. When I inevitably sink back down to lower states and lose sight of that higher perspective, continue to act on those decision even though I may no longer feel as committed to them. Over time, my external circumstances will change in ways that reinforce those higher states. Living consciously gets easier with practice.

#### Blocks to truth

1.  Media conditioning.
2.  Social conditioning.
3.  False beliefs.
4.  Emotional interference.
5.  Addictions.
6.  Immaturity.
7.  Secondary gain.
