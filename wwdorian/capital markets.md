Everything that we do could be seen as our investments, and we naturally expect to have some [[returns from investments]]. Considering the roles that actually barter, there are two major [[types of investors]]. And, if we only think about money as the returns, there would then be three vital questions to answer:

1. Am I being realistic about how much should I earn?
2. Am I prepared for the risks?
3. Am I comfortable with daily changes in my portfolio?













1. Stocks in the US trade on 2 major markets
	1) New York Stock Exchange (NYSE)
		- Have a physical location on Wall Street in New York City
		- More traditional. Companies listed on the NYSE tend to be older and more stable. (GE, Procter & Gamble, Coca Cola)
	2) National Association of Securities Dealers Automated Quotation (NASDAQ):
		- Over-the-counter (OTC) exchange
		- No physical place for stock trade
		- An electronic system of matching the buyers and sellers of stocks
		- More tech-focused companies

*listed*: meaning the stocks trade on the exchange that buyers and sellers go through

2. Some other exchanges outside stocks **enable investors to trade other types of investments (e.g. stock options, commodities & currencies)**:
	- Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME)
	- Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE)
	- New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX)

3. Another major type of investments besides stocks, Bonds:
	- Form of debt that companies sell to investors in exchange for receiving a type of interest payment over time
	- Trade mostly from investor to investor - big banks help to facilitate such trades
	- Bonds are not traded on an exchange; they are purchased from the issuer and traded between investors.

4. The shrinking stock market: **more difficult** for individual investors to find great stocks
	- Large companies buy smaller ones
	- Fewer companies go public

*Initial Public Offering (IPO)*: the first time a stock is sold to the general public

*Diversification*: Owning a variety of stocks to minimise the risk of a portfolio

American Depository Receipts (ADR): foreign firms trading in the U.S.

The higher the return on an investment, the greater the risk.

- Stock market:
	- System that enables companies to sell partial ownership in themselves to people in exchange for cash
	- Common stocks have the highest rate of return
		- A common stock is a certificate that indicates ownership in part of a corporation
		- a share = a part of a company; indicate ownership rights in proportion to the share of the firm; people who has a share: shareholder/stockholder
	- shareholder rights:
		- elect Board of Directors
		- change Corporate Charter
		- receive dividend, usually /share*year
		- bondholders (debt holders) > preferred stockholders (debt holders) > shareholders
		- shareholders' liability is limited to the amount of his investment

Investment returns: earn part of a company's profit after getting an ownership stake via stock

|           Stock           |       Bond       |
|:-------------------------:|:----------------:|
| ownership stake in a firm | loan to the firm | 

Stocks + Bonds = Capital Markets

Bid & Ask -> Market Price - market order
bid at a specific price -x> market price - limited order

Mutual Funds & Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs): basket of individual stocks that can be bought to allow **instant diversification**; ETF trades through an exchange

It's a bad idea to look at the performance of mutual funds as investment criteria. Rather, it is far better to look at the allocation asset classes of mutual funds and then the cost of the mutual fund to decide whether to invest in.

Long term benefits, Stocks.

Treasury Bills (T-Bills): short term bonds issued by the US Treasury that mature in less than a year.

Two types of companies:
- value companies
	- modestly priced
	- mature firms
	- more stable
	- industries that are not rapidly growing
	- more volatile than the overall market
- growth companies
	- fast growing
	- lower profit levels
	- relatively expensive

Stock should only be a part of the portfolio.

One way to partially avoid the risk of buying stocks is to use the idea of **call options**: gives the right but not the obligation to **buy** a stock at a particular price until some time in the future.

For sellers of the call options, this strategy is called a "covered call". 1. They get some income from the premium up front. 2. They get the money from the selling of the stock at the strike price.
