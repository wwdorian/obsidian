### what is business analysis (BA)

BA is "understanding the business needs." Or rather, it is the process by which we **identify business needs**, **recommend relevant solutions**, and **understand requirements**.

A business analyst should:
1. Be constantly observing and questioning.
2. Have a naturally inquisitive and detail oriented mind.
3. Be always analysing everything.

> The practice of *enabling change* in the context of an enterprise by defining needs and recommending solutions that deliver value to stakeholders.
> ***International Institute of Business Analysis/IIBA***

A project delivers: a service/product/result -> solution (when doing BA).

1. Understand
	1. Current needs.
	2. Overall strategic objectives.
	3. Goals of the organisation.
2. Help
	1. Achieve goals.

### situation statement

The format:

"The (problem/opportunity) has the effect of (x) with the resulting impact of (y)."

An example:

"The (existing process of processing returns involves a need to submit paperwork duplicating the digital record). This results in (significant delays and extra labour costs). The resulting impact is that (additional staff is hired to meet established quotas)."

Tools:
1. Ishikawa/fishbone Diagram
2. Five Whys(for adaptive/agile projects)

**Solutions** in a business context is defined as *something developed to deliver measurable business value*.

Business needs fall into three broad categories:
1. Problem or potential improvements.
2. Opportunities or new endeavours.
3. Compliance requirements.

### stakeholders

Stakeholders are *individual, group, or organisation that may affect, be affected by, or perceive itself to be affected by a decision, activity, or outcome of a program or project**.

It is crucial to know how to classify the stakeholders - not every stakeholder could be considered equal. One of the common tools is the **stakeholder power/interest grid**:
