An idea may be invented for analytical purposes, and that is often seen in mathematics for example. The idea of angels surely shed light on analyses of human nature and of other things, but the idea first is deeply linked to religion.

Angels are God's messengers, carrying God's will and let man know what God wants. So in this way of understanding, angels are God's agents. Funnily, the word "agency" in the phrase "by/through the agency of somebody" means "action" since the phrase means "as a result of the action of somebody/something". The interrelation suggests that God is like man have actions, and his actions are done through the help of His angels. Isn't that quite similar to what we have today? Technology helps man carrying his wills and doing what he wants.

> IT WOULD BE misleading to suppose that the idea of angels is primarily a construction of the philosophers - a fiction invented for their analytical purposes; or that it is imply their conception of a supra-mundane reality, concerning the existence and nature of which they dispute. In the literature of western civilisation, angels first appear by name or reference in the Old and the New Testaments. Readers of the Bible will remember many scenes in which an angel of the Lord performs the mission of acquainting man with God's will. Among the most memorable of such occasions are the visits of the angels to Abraham and Lot and the angelic ministry of Gabriel in the Annunciation to Mary.
