Everything starts from the human desire to have more -- especially, money. We, therefore, would put our money into the markets and expect it to generate some income for us. So everything starts from asking this question: **"How much can I earn from my investments?"**

When we think about that question, it is natural to regard the amount of money that we earned from our successful investments as **returns**.

There are two major types of investments: **[[stocks]]**, and **[[bonds]]**. Mostly, stock/equity returns *beat* bond returns. However, one important fact is that *returns fluctuate*. That means **risks**.

***With greater returns come greater risks.***
