In the process during which we short list the best two alternative Enterprise Systems, we first identified our research question, that is: company D is actually facing a risk situation on its supply chain management which would require the overall stringent data capture ability at all levels of its information processing operations. That means it needs to upgrade its Enterprise System (ES) to deal with and sort out the current problem. Therefore, we went to find out whether there are alternative ESs that would enable company D in terms of such. The two alternatives we chose are JD Edwards EnterpriseOne (Oracle) and Sage ERP X3 (Sage). Both of the two ERPs can work on a global scale and could take control of the entire business value chains for company D, and they are both modernised and can be tailored to suit the needs of the company. It is worth mentioning and seized our attention that Oracle provides private cloud services which would enable data sync on a global scale {Oracle, 2021 #880}. Moreover, Sage has, especially, expertise in management for food and beverage industry {Sage, 2021 #881}.
