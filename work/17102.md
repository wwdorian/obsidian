1. deceptive advertising the right of customers-to be informed
2. stakeholder theory
3. Customer movement-to protect customers benefit

The issues that are presented in the film are closely related to these three ideas: deceptive advertising which ignores the right of customers to be informed authentically, stakeholder theory, and customer movement which intends to protect and promote cusotmers' benefit.

The film addresses problems related the action of over, or rather, excessive shopping. Such a phenomenon would only take place when the material comforts are of abundance, which leads to decreasing demand of customers. There, then, must be some viable ways to promote the products or services for corporations {Idowu, 2014 #547}. Regarding this, deceptive advertising is, which by definition suggests misleading promotion, used to exploit its audience's natural desire while purposefully ignores the right of customers: to be informed, authentically {Passarini, 2017 #863}. This should cause alert since the world in this regard has "fallen a prey to the loudest and most persistent propagandists" {Hutchins, 1952 #827}. The film directly discusses these problems that come with deceptive advertising and suggests that they would have long-term and increasingly serious implications, as also have been shown by related literature {Gangi, 2019 #113}. For example, people have been in the craze of "shop till you drop" which is unconsciously led by corporations using deceptive advertising to create incentives, and this is only one case. The capital always wants to reproduce itself, and deceptive advertising plays as a mediator. In such craze, people also ignore the fact that it is their right not to be misled, and neglect that it is their right to be informed.

Such an undertaking could be regarded as wrong from a deontological perspective, since customers are the ones who corporations should be responsible for, and thus they are corporations' stakeholders {Alexander, 2020 #650}. The "shop till you drop" happened because these corporations are serving their shareholders, instead of their stakeholders, the theory of which stresses upon sustainable as well as ethical corporate governance. Most corporations that intend to promote themselves and their brands via advertisement should not add flavours to the truth, i.e. it would be against a company's stakeholder responsibility policy and would have lasting negative effects on the company in the future, financially or otherwise {Dhaliwal, 2014 #759}. Considering the fact that consumers are stakeholders, and they have bargaining power to a certain extent, the film could be used to research how the understanding as well as the implementation of the stakeholder theory could elevate a corporation's performance. It can actually be understood that if the bond between a corporation and its customers, i.e. stakeholders, the more is the possibility of customer retention, and thus more revenue {Deegan, 2006 #745}.

From the two analyses above, it could be known that corporations should think of better ways other than deceptive advertising to promote their products and services. However, due to the fact that most corporations violate consumers' rights intentionally, there would need some activities in the form of a movement, i.e. customer movement. The film "shop till you drop" is an example: People gather together to fight against the corporations who breached their right to be informed about the actual products and who intentionally promoted the products with the assistance of deceptive advertising. And, since rights protected by law, it would be able to push the corporations to take a stakeholder approach, because corporations are also influenced by the political and environment in which it practices its strategies {Freeman, 2010 #545}.
