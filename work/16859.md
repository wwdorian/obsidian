## Company Background

The brand, Jeep, is a registered trademark of Fiat Chrysler US LLC (FCA US LLC) who has a subsidiary, FCA Australia Pty Ltd in Australia where it conducts its business in the industry of Motor Vehicle and Parts Distribution {IBISWorld, 2021 #875}. There are other brands that are promoted by the company, including Chrysler and Dodge which are themselves well known by many people.  FCA Australia Pty Ltd (FCA Australia) is a foreign owned proprietary company, whose major revenue is generated from importing, distributing and marketing motor vehicles and other manufactured parts {IBISWorld, 2021 #875}. FCA Australia has nearly 120 employees, who are administered from the company's Head Office at Port Melbourne, in Victoria, and the company conducts its business across Australia {IBISWorld, 2021 #875}.

The Jeep trademark which is one of FCA Australia's major products, owned by FCA US LLC, is distributed in Australia, nationwide, carrying its unique and legendary history that are favoured by its consumers. The brand is originally born in the 1940s, during which Jeep has already been liked by a number of soldiers over the world {Jeep, 2021 #879}. Along with the technological progress in the later years, the brand also has incorporated developments in terms of technology and innovation, and has been successful to this day, over the past 80 years. The subsidiary of the company that owns the brand, FCA Australia has been promoting the brand since it was incorporated in Australia in June 14th, 2007 {IBISWorld, 2021 #875}.

There had been some decrease in 2018 to 2019 for FCA Australia in terms of its financial performance, mainly due to the COVID-19 pandemic that caused the phenomenon that people would not have the chance to use the car since there were lockdown and border shut among nations, and FCA Australia has seen some improvements from 2019 to 2020 in its assets, although the total revenue it made during that time was less than it was before 2019 {IBISWorld, 2021 #875}. Since FCA Australia operates its business entirely in the Motor Vehicle and Parts Distribution industry, it is dependent on the resilience of supply chain and the sustainability of the value chain of the industry. From such a perspective, the research is then conducted.

## Macro-Environment Analysis

The industry that FCA Australia is in is the Motor Vehicle and Parts Distribution industry, which includes vehicle parts wholesaling and retailing as its functional segmentation. The brand, Jeep, however, mainly operates in the industry of Motor Vehicle Wholesaling in Australia. This industry, whose operators wholesale new and used vehicles to dealers and users as well as individuals, has been impacted seriously by the COVID-19 pandemic, along with other industries. With this as a background, a PESTLE analysis along with the Porter's Five Forces analysis would enable as well as empower the company with an overview and thorough understanding of the industry in which it operates and be able to strategically move forward against the COVID-19 pandemic which has caused revenue loss.

### PEST Analysis

The PEST analysis is a model that is used to position a company which provides insights as to the current environment and related implications. Each of the four alphabets stands for: political factors, economic factors, social factors, and technological factors {Williams, 2014 #802}. This PESTLE analysis is conducted on the motor vehicle wholesaling industry for the FCA Australia who owns the brand Jeep.

#### Political Factors

Political factors are of minor and light influence on the motor vehicle wholesaling market. Australia motor vehicle company in the related wholesaling industry are mostly subject to light regulation {IBISWorld, 2021 #876}. There are regulations mostly imposed upon the importation of the products, since the importers, in this case to be FCA Australia, must register with Australian Customs Services and are approved to be an importer. They would also need to submit formal requests for approval to the Department of Transport's Vehicle Safety Standards branch before they carry out any business related to importing {IBISWorld, 2021 #876}. Such an issue is always around the companies, and they then have to regulate themselves because of being members, in most cases, of the Federal Chamber of Automotive Industries (FCAI) {IBISWorld, 2021 #876}.

However, these policies are upon the importation instead of otherwise which has made Australia one of the most open car markets around the globe {IBISWorld, 2021 #876}. There are exclusivity contracts between car makers and suppliers, and that has enabled companies who work as importers the easiness to approach strong dealers, regardless of training and growth stages {IBISWorld, 2021 #876}.

#### Economic Factors

The economic factors have a medium influence on the industry. The level of volatility of revenue generated in the industry over the past five years have been moderate, in the way as it has been before. The economic factors are mostly in pace with economic activities, and this would lead to the COVID-19 pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic has been significantly influencing the Australian economy during 2019 and 2020, and is likely to have long-standing influence on the economy in the future. This is a factor that would cause economic volatility {IBISWorld, 2021 #876}.

Furthermore, there would be lesser consumer confidence in the industry and that has been falling over the previous five years. The reason for the lesser confidence is due to the fact that Australian dollar has been depreciating, and this would cause consumer demand to be reduced, and thus, the vehicles that are imported would become more costly than they were before.

#### Social Factors

The society includes the industry's shareholders and stakeholders. Along with the impact brought by the COVID-19 pandemic, the company, FCA Australia, has been required by the government to submit a report in which it would list in detail of their business operations that may have the implication of modern slavery, both in their supply chains and other operations in the market, under the Modern Slavery Act 2018 (Cth) {IBISWorld, 2021 #875}.

This act would cause the company and other corporations in the industry to have to deal with the risk of being accused of modern slavery, since operators in the industry must submit explanations and have to report the actions they have taken to lower down the possibility of conducting modern slavery {IBISWorld, 2021 #876}.

#### Technological Factors

Technological factors imply the possibility of disruptions which would lead to threats for the company. With the rate of new patent technologies that are newly permitted in the industry being low, potential innovations that may lead to disruptions are stagnated, therefore. While the concentration of technologies is high, which indicates that the company must be prepared for unforeseeable risks brought by innovation. However, the entry barrier is moderate, so, the new entrants are less likely to be a threat for the company.

#### Resources and Key Success Factors

The research and analyses above have indicated some of the key factors that would contribute to the success for FCA Australia, and some of the resources would be of the same benefit. Considering the factors that have been discussed above using the PEST analysis model, it could be argued that the resources that would be in the company's favour would include the technological innovations, and a stress and gesture of Corporate Social Responsibility which would highlight the company in terms of its contribution to the Australian people and society, which would lead to more purchase of FCA Australia's cars since they would trust the company more in the background of the COVID-19 pandemic which has led them to distrust many corporations that pose themselves as considering more shareholders' interests instead of their stakeholders'.

##### Threats of new entrants

The threat of new entrants are of low possibility, since the entry barrier is of a moderate level, and a low rate of new entrants. With the rate of new patent technologies being low as well, the possibilities that new entrants causing disruption is also unlikely.

##### Threats of substitutes

There are other players in the wholesaling market and they are likely to have impact on consumers' decision making process which would lead to them choosing other cars that are not imported by FCA Australia. The understanding should be made that this threat is unlikely to disappear due to the fact that FCA Australia only takes up 4% of the market share {IBISWorld, 2021 #876}.


##### Competitive Rivalry

The threats of substitutes for Jeep owned by FCA Australia is high. There are several competitors that are already in the industry, and since FCA Australia has only 4.0% of the entire market share, with the fact that the former overseas parent company had filed for bankruptcy in 2009, there is high competition rates in the market {IBISWorld, 2021 #876}.

There are also other barriers made by others, i.e. the major companies in the market, such as Toyota Motor Corporation Australia Limited, Mazda Australia Pty Limited, and Mitsubishi Motors Australia Limited. These companies combined account for nearly 40.0% percent of the market share in its total.

##### The Bargaining Power of Consumers

Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the consumers have less money since the money would be reserved for essentials for lives, and since the Australian dollar has been depreciating, the cars that are imported would be more expensive than before, so the bargaining power of consumers would increase, and it is likely that the company, FCA Australia, would need to take some actions to invest in promotion instead of importing.

##### The Bargaining Power of Suppliers

It is unlikely that the bargaining power of suppliers would increase in degree, since that the borders among countries have been shut with the widespread of the COVID-19 pandemic, and other economies in the world have also been hugely impacted by it. The suppliers would desire more to export their products and cars into the Australian market, while the company would not due to their financial performance which is caused by the bargaining power of consumers that is discussed above. Therefore, the risk of this aspect is low.

### Strategy Identification

Due to the border shut among countries in the world to try to prevent the COVID-19 pandemic from further spread, and also because of the fact that supply chain resilience has been impacted by it, the innovation in technology would be of great importance for the company, for example, in upgrading the company's information and communication technologies (ICT) {Perron, 2010 #856}. Also, to demonstrate a responsible image and to actually carry out such activities would increase the FCA Australia's social reputation which could benefit the company with regard to financial performance {Wang, 2015 #19}{Gangi, 2019 #113}.

First of all, innovations in ICT would enable FCA Australia to have better control over their supply chain whose resilience has been influenced by the COVID-19 pandemic to the extent to which the potential risk of stock out might occur {El Baz, 2021 #605}. The ICT would enable the company with better strategies to sync data with other wholesalers and retailers and thus have more responsiveness to the market change and other influences, for example, with Big Data {Brinch, 2018 #657}. There would also need to be some basic understandings of the supply chain resilience, if to discuss the strategy further.

The idea of supply resilience is to increase the robustness of the supply chain as one key component of a company's value chains {Kochan, 2018 #606}. The lack of such resilience would lead to some stock out phenomenon at retail stores or wholesale stacks, which influences the financial performance in a direct manner. Regarding this, to keep supply chain resilience and even to promote it are actually strategies to help the company deal with potential risks. When dealing with risks, there would need some strategies to manage the risks so as to mitigate them, or even to avoid them. The concept of supply chain resilience is thus contributing to the risk management strategies, in that the company would need to deal less with the risks that might happen when the supply chain of it is resilient enough, so the risk in the future has already been mitigated {Vilko, 2014 #632}.

Researchers in the field of business robustness and supply chain management have concluded that it is to be anticipated that interests of companies of digitisation and automation would prosper, especially after the COVID-19 pandemic, in the case that the virus has been dealt with. They have carried out surveys in Australia and have, based upon the data collected, found that such technologies, as ICT, would empower industries and companies in them in regards of supply chain optimisation, supply chain sustainability and resiliency, and customer relationship management {Hopkins, 2021 #673}. So, for FCA Australia, this would be a good start to revive its business during the COVID-19 pandemic and especially post-COVID.

Moreover, it would be of greater benefit for FCA Australia to conduct its CSR accounting and reporting, especially with empowerment from sustainability theory {Sheehy, 2015 #115}. CSR has been a great tool, proven by many large corporations around the world, for promoting the company's social image and reputation, as well as elevating their financial performance {Wang, 2015 #19}. The idea is that accountable CSR reporting would be strengthening consumers' confidence in the company, and considering the fact that consumer confidence is at low degree at present, it is a good technique that FCA Australia could utilise to promote itself as well as its cars.

Furthermore, the investment in CSR accounting and reporting would benefit the company also because CSR is directly related to stakeholders of a company {Dhaliwal, 2014 #759}. The classical view is that a corporation's main objective is to maximise its profitability and revenue generating ability, but this view doesn't hold true when in the circumstance in this century where transparency is demanded nearly everywhere in the world, which is due to the fact that environmental problems are being more and more serious and that people's concerns about this is increasing {Idowu, 2014 #547}. This has been contributed by the COVID-19 pandemic as well as the 2019/2020 Australian bushfires crisis {Readfearn, 2021 #837}. People are growing their attention paid on the climate change and environment issues, and thus demand more from corporations to take responsibilities in protecting the environment since every one is a stakeholder when it is about the planet. And thus, responsible sustainability CSR accounting and reporting would help FCA Australia with a stronger pose in the market and thus more market share.
