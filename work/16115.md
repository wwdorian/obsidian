When regarding the adoption of upgraded ERPs such as Oracle and Sage, we think it is a must to investigate company D's strengths and weaknesses, and its competitors, since investment in a new ERP would be costly, and due to that it would be installed globally and on the entire value chains, the company would need to identify which ERP is better.

### Company D:
#### Strengths
1. Serving a large Caribbean country with exclusive distribution rights
2. The rights are for many high quality brands of products mainly from Europe
3. Has its own distribution transportation system

#### Weaknesses
1. Demand for replenishment is defined by employees and are managed manually or via email
2. Close relationship needs to be maintained to sync the data of demand with plan

#### Opportunities
1. Exclusive distribution rights provide supply chain with resilience
2. Company D is considering open a merchant's portal to enable online purchase and subsequent delivery through its transportation system

#### Threats
1. Inefficient supply chain management leads to loss in market share
2. Supply chain is not resilient enough since there might be errors made in forecasting and syncing demand for replenishment
