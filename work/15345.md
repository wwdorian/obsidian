# Innovations in Social Media Marketing

## Introduction

Greetings, all. Today I want to discuss with you innovations in Social Media Marketing, aka SMM. The field of SMM belongs to digital marketing, which uses digital technology and applications to improve existing marketing strategy, as well as to enhance customer experience.

## Why SMM?

SMM, short for Social Media Marketing, has the power to reach people who are already interested in the industry.

The reason why more and more organisations nowadays are shifting to SMM is embedded in the essence of SMM: the Social. A society is one when it is populated. No longer reachable are people on TVs and newspapers. They are online on social platforms. And marketing is to reach people - to go where people go.

That's why SMM is in demand by organisations.

## My Pitch: Innovation = Creativity + Exploitation (ICE for artwork)

SMM is to create content that are tailor-made to the context of each social media platform for the purpose of driving user engagement and sharing. (Patel, 2021)

In my view SMM is not just to drive user engagement, but to drive conversion. Because the best social media campaigns all have one thing in common: they engage people and make them talk.

People talk about new things because they are exciting, and excitement is an emotional response. So newness is from change, and changes happen every second in the digital world. We should definitely try to combine the two: art.

People long for art. We all want to live, instead of just survive. The messages we receive online every day keep reminding us that there's so much we haven't seen, and we want to see. Art, in this point of view, is a quest that points to a higher stratum of life where beauty dominates.

People are in urgent need of this, and social media have paved the way.

## An Art Prototype

It could be possible that we create artworks that is not only defined by their creators - everyone has a perspective, so everyone can give opinion about it. But that's not enough. What if the artwork is interactive, in a way as a kaleidoscope?

We can create an art prototype, i.e. an artwork that is open to perspectives and responds to them, yet is indeed finished by the artist. The idea is the same as quantum theory: the art is finished in its own time, but is not yet finished to the observer until it is perceived. It is only finished through the collaboration of the artist and the audience.

## Possibility?

This idea could be employed by many artists, companies, and organisations. People have surprisingly positive emotional reactions to new forms or ways in which things are presented to them, and that could be seen as a way of commercial opportunities, according to Alamäki's research from this year where the AR applications were tested. (2021)

This idea is commercially viable not only in that artwork itself can be profitable, but also that:

1.  The whole process is essentially "Experience Redesign". We are overly used to the mundane everyday life to the extent of getting sick of it. New experiences call for the desire to share with others, and that's where SMM enters into the play.
2.  SMM entails sharing on social platforms - that brings influence. Influence is assets, and assets mean value.
3.  The value is self-reproducible, because the content of it, i.e. the artwork, is shared, and influence gets bigger the more it gets exposed.
4.  Companies and other commercial organisations could in the process play a part as patrons and many sorts of important roles. And since the artwork needs to be interactive, the devices and other equipment can only be supported by companies and organisations.

The 4 steps above, with planning ahead, are in accordance with the RACE Framework, aka, "Reach, Act, Convert, Engage".

## Challenges and Limitations

The challenges mainly concern people's appreciation for the artwork. New things eventually become new norms, and norms are dull. It requires artists to constantly create new works, which in some sense streamlines the creative process. And streamlining is enemy to creativity.

Also, there may be some technological difficulties and people may be able to tell the difference between the artwork and reality unlike they do when experiencing Augmented Reality or Mixed Reality.

Third, who should be responsible for the instant feedback remains an issue. The artist may as well prefer to work on projects instead of being engrossed in the interactions with the audience.
