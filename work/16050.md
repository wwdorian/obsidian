### 1. What are some of the most ancient spaces of exchange?


### 2. Were they interior or exterior and how did they relate to spaces of dwelling, settlement and ritual? (examples)
### 3. Define the industrial revolution and explain how it acted as a social and economic force that shaped new spaces of exchange (examples)

There is such a type of architecture: the space of exchange. This type of architecture is defined mostly by its usage, i.e. the buildings of this category is used for the reciprocal action among human beings for one another's resources. In this sense, the purist form of exchange is monetary. However, before, in ancient times, the ancestors, who are financial predecessors, used actual stock in exchange of stock, at a certain place, in a specific building for such a purpose - this purpose later turned into an undertaking, a profession. There are numerous places in such an antiquarian spirit, for example, the Mercantile Hall, Delos, in 4th Century BCE:

And the Trajan's Market, in the 1st Century:

These two places are both exterior, i.e. they are spaces that are open for people to go in. However, in the sense of the activities that actually took place, the exchange happened inside the buildings. Exchange of resources is a proclaim of one's own property, and the recognition of such rights of the other party in the exchange. It is quite similar to what happened in the spaces of dwelling, settlement, and ritual: people exchange conversations with their souls in dwellings, space with their fellow men, and prayers with their gods/goddesses they believe.

The industrial revolution, however, commercialised and monetised the spaces of exchange. It demystified the space, and transmuted it into a place that is constantly shaped by human desires, which are to be regulated. The industrial revolution has, as a social and economic force, conquered the human minds in their perceptions of spaces of exchange: there are only digitised money that are flowing in such spaces, and the humanity, representing both human beings and their innate qualities of goodness, is thus masked, or has disappeared.
